<h1>KIA's Clue Guide</h1>

<h2 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h2>
<p>
This might seem uneccessary, but I'm writing this for the novice
player(s) as to the experienced ones. So here's a few expressions
used by players and what they mean.
</p>

<p>
<b>Spacecontrol:</b>	
This term is often used when assistance is needed near a planet, either 
because the enemy is preparing an assault or that your team needs help 
clearing the enemy planet from enemy ships.</p>

<p>
<b>Twink:</b>		
Often used by "experienced" players to name newbie players. I try not to 
use it myself (we were all there once).</p>

<p>
<b>LPS:</b>		
Last Planet Stand. The enemies last planet which should be the worst 
possible one defending. Far away from the enemy homeworld, and preferably not
an AGRI or FUEL planet.</p>

<p>
<b>Scummer:</b>	
A person that are mainly playing to get high stats and doesnt really care 
about his own team. This type of player is also known as DI-scummer.</p>

<p>
<b>d++:</b>		
This a very cryptic but useful way to describe that an enemy player is 
carrying armies. This particilour case (d++) would mean that the enemy 
ship with the letter d has picked up 2 armies. A + indicates an army. b++++ 
would mean that b has picked up 4 armies. This is also used when planets 
"pop", TAU++ means that there is excess armies at TAU.</p>


<p>
<b>Pop:</b> 		
This is a expression used when planets create new armies. This is often 
used to alert your teammates that one of the enemy (or friendly) planets has
armies that should be taken care of. This might mean bombing or picking up 
(Ex."tau popped").</p>

<p>
<b>@:</b>
The '@' sign is used instead of 'at' because its shorter to type. "tau @ 5" 
is one way to indicate that there is excess armies at the planet 'tau'.</p>

<p>
<b>DI:</b>
Means "Damage Inflicted"</p>

<p>
<b>Ogg(ing):</b>
When you OGG someone, it means that you try to kill a certain player by all 
means without caring about your own ship, it's more or less a suicide 
attack. This attackform is mainly used against other players that carry 
armies or that are potential carriers (see Ogging further down for more info).</p>

<p>
<b>Plock:</b>
A shorter word for Phasor Lock.</p>

<p>
<b>Core:</b>
The 4 planets closest to the homeworld and of course the homeworld itself.</p>

<p>
<b>Potential Carrier:</b>
A enemy player that has kills. Make sure to track this player to see if he
picks up and then announce it to the rest of your team (se above).</p>


<h2 id="cluehints">The way to become a "clued" player</h2>
First, there are no shortcuts. You have to play alot and get experience
but here is a few hints that will help you on the way.
<ul>
<li>Look at the strategic map more than 50%, this is really important and
    you have to look at it even when dogfighting, escorting and/or taking
    planets.</li>

<li>Look at the playerlist every now and then, this to see which of the
    enemy players that are potential carriers. Keep an eye at those
    players with kills and keep track on them if they pick up armies,
    dont forget to alert your teammates.</li>

<li>You have to keep an eye at the message window as well, this to see
    if any of your teammates has spotted a enemy carrier or if your team
    needs help escorting etc.</li>

<li>When you died and your ship 'res' in at the homeworld, don't just rush
    at maxwarp to the front and then start to think about what to do. Check
    if there is anything important that you could do to help your team right
    away as you appear at the homeworld.
	<ul>
	<li>Helping a friendly carrier thats in trouble in your own core. This
	    could mean checking the enemy SC bomber to help save a pop or to simply
	    kill him off before he can hurt your carrier.</li>
	<li>Check if there is a friendly ship thats leaving the front to move back
	    to pickup. Move in his direction to be able to help him if he's beeing
	    ogged, if there is a ogger you might be able to pick up an easy kill.
	    Anyway, since he's leaving the front your presence there will probably
	    be needed, controlling etc.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>


<h2 id="dogfighting">Dogfighting</h2>
<p>
<b>Maneuvering:</b>
When dogfighting you need to keep changing your speed, this will make 
it much harder for enemy ships to calculate where to aim at. Most of 
the time I fly at warp 2 dodging and turning all the time, this combined
with sudden rushes and speed changes works really well for me.
Remember to 'det' torps that you cant dodge, better to 'det' them than 
letting your shield/hull take a real beating. I also use 'det' to create 
"holes" in torpedostreams, which I can dodge through.
</p>

<p>
<b>Fire:</b>
I Never fire 8 torps salvoes unless I'm 100% sure to hit something, it 
costs a lot of fuel and you cant afford running out of fuel when that 
enemy ogger might be coming at you with warp 9. I fire 3-5 torps at the 
time carefully aimed, use your phasor when you get within the 15-20 pts
range. (Remember to use pressor if you get too close to him, explosions 
hurt)
</p>

<p>
<b>Damage Control:</b>
This is something that's very hard to do, especially if you're a new
player. Since a ship repairs BOTH its hull and shield at the same time
it's really beneficial to be able to take some damage in the hull and
the rests on the shield. The really hard thing is to figure out HOW
much damage you can allow on the hull since damage to your hull lowers
your maxwarp as well. Of course damage control in the smaller ships,
DD, SC is questionable, I've never done it in any other ships than the
CA, BB and SB.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hints:</b>
Remember to count the hits inflicted on the opponent. Lets say I fly
a cruiser (CA) and I dogfight an enemy cruiser, I hit him with 3 torps 
(each makes 40 points of damage) + a 20 points phasor I know that he's  
almost done for (140 points of damage from his total of 200), another
60 points and he buys the farm. 
</p>

<p>
At all times remember to conserve fuel, fuel is more vital that most
people realize. A ship without fuel is a sitting duck (more or less).
Remember to keep your shields down as much as you can, it saves alot
of fuel.
</p>

<p>
The most important thing tho is keeping one eye at the strategic map, 
this to avoid enemy oggers and most important to spot cloaked enemy 
planettakers coming your way. 
</p>

<h2 id="escorting">Escorting</h2>
<p>
<b>Position:</b>
This is a little different from case to case. If your team is about
to take a frontline planet then try to clear that planet from enemies.
If there are no enemies around move up a bit and stay between the
closest enemy and the planet. Then you have ground to fall back on and
buttorp any onrushing defenders.
</p>

<p>
Core takes is a little different tho, then you should wait for your
taker to get ready and together with him and the other escorts move in
and push them off the planet. Never rush off to the planet ahead of all 
the others that will only alert enemy defenders and you will find your-
self outnumbered and killed (to no use). Stay between the enemy and your 
planettaker and remember to 'det' torpedoes heading towards him. 
</p>

<p>
Of course all the above is depending on the situation
</p>

<p>
When escorting a taker be agressive (No don't run at warp 9 towards
the enemys buttorps) put preassure on the defenders by shooting torps
and phasors. If you're outnumbering the defenders mutualing with them
is a good option, but remember the longer it takes to clear a planet
the more defenders will arrive.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hints:</b>
After your team has taken the planet it will be very wounerable so
you and your team has to defend it right after the take. This applies
especially to AGRI planets wich will "pop" very fast, stay close and
protect the planet it pays off.
</p>

<h2 id="planetdefence">Planetdefence</h2>
<p>
<b>Position:</b>
When defending planets the most important thing is to keep track of
the enemy planettakers, use the strategic map to keep an eye at cloakers.
When you notice an assault against a planet in your sector alert
your teammates (use team message line) and move to the planet fast.
If the enemy planettaker has escortships with him you have be very
good at delaying them so your teammates can get there in time. I
prefer to ignore the escort (if I have 1:2+ in odds) and just cloak 
and go for the carrier. I have found that this slows the planettaker
more than if I would have stayed at the planet and tried to dogfight
his escort(s).
</p>

<p>
If alone at a planet thats under assault by multiple enemies, DISTRESS 
and then DELAY the take, Stay alive, lob torps, phasor, look threathening,
the important thing is to get more defenders there in time to stop the take, 
its unessential who gets the carrier in the end as long as you stop their 
take.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hints:</b>
When I notice a lonely cloak coming my way I wait with firing at
him. I wait for him to make his move towards the planet (remember 
he's the one running out of fuel) and then I blast him into pieces 
with phaser and torps. 
</p>

<p>
If you fire like a madman at him wasting all your fuel he will dodge 
and when he sees that you're out of fuel he goes in and takes/bombs 
the planet and you cant do shit about it. Remember to keep a cool 
head, with this tactic I have nailed lots and lots of carriers. 
</p>

<p>
Another thing, when you have fired your torps at the cloaked carrier 
or over the planet and you score no hits, 'det' your own torps and 
fire again. Don't let him get that second or two until you can fire 
again, this might be the thing that saves your planet or not.
</p>

<h2 id="planettaking">Planettaking</h2>
<p>
<b>Planets:</b>
When taking planets you have to choose the most strategic planet to
take for your team. The enemy AGRI planets are prime targets since
they can produce more armies than an ordinary planet. Other important
planets are of course fuel and repair planets in the frontline. Be
flexible, if you see that the planet of your choice is too heavily
guarded switch to an easier target and get it before they knew what
happened.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ships:</b>
Depending a little on what kind of planet you about to take you should
chose the ship thats most qualified for the mission. I tend to use the
CA when taking frontline planets and the 3rd space planets. When going
into their core I usually use the DD bacause its good maneuvrability
and feint and dodge my way though while remaining cloaked. For LPS
situations the AS ship is probably the best choice. Because of its extra
hull you will get that extra half a second to beam down that extra army and 
that really counts. The AS also has a great cloaking ability. Scouts are 
perfect in the engame as well, use the SC to sneak in and drop armies on 
whatever planets the enemy has left. That will weaken their defenses and 
give them less armies to use for retaking planets.
</p>

<p>
When carrying in the CA I help my escorts clear the planet instead of
just cloaking, this really speeds up the take and you will be able to
take the planet before more defenders can arrive. Learn to dogfight well
and use it while you're carrying.
</p>

<b>Oggers:</b>
As soon as you have 2+ kills you are a hot target for enemy oggers,
and they'll be coming at you until you're dead. This is when the
strategic map comes in real handy, keep an eye at cloakers coming
your way and as always alert your teammates that you are carrying
and might need help. If there is only 1 cloaker coming at you at
the time you will probably manage all by your self, the trick is 
to NEVER run out of fuel. Basically I keep to 2 simple strategies:

<ol>
<li>As I see the cloaker coming my way I remain at speed 3-4 moving
  slowly away from him, when he gets real close (just about to uncloak) 
  I press maxwarp, turn at a 90 degree angle from him, and
  use pressorbeam at him (if he has uncloaked) and buttorp him. 
  Try to cripple him instead of just killing him, if you cripple him
  he will sit damaged in your core and just watch you go for the take
  without beeing able to do anything. Remember to 'det' his torps if 
  it looks as if they're going to hit.</li>

<li>Just cloak and run at a 90 degree angle away from him. The best thing
  is if you can sneak by him and charge against a planet and take it 
  before he gets there.</li>
</ol>

<p>   
<b>Hints:</b>
Remember to cloak when you go in to take the planet, if you're not
enemy pressors and tractors will pull you out of orbit and they'll
shoot you and your valuable armies into atoms. 
</p>

<p>
If you are moving in towards an enemy planet and an enemy comes 
acing towards you firing all that hes got, slow down let him waste 
all his fuel at a target he believes is orbiting the planet. When his 
torps has passed move in and take the planet. 
</p>

<p>
If I see a torpstream coming right at me while I'm beaming down I
quickly raise my shield, 'det' them and continue beaming down, this 
might give me that extra second I need to finish the planettake instead
of getting blasted right away.
</p>

<p>
There is a neat trick that might work from time to time. If I'm
moving in towards a planet cloaked and the defender starts to fire
torps at the planet (hoping for the lucky shot) I 'det' the single
torp and he usually thinks that was a hit on me and fires all hes
got at that spot, then move in and get the planet before he understands
that he's been had.
</p>

<p>
I mentioned earlier that speed is important, always make sure that
you know where you are going even BEFORE you have picked up armies.
When I'm moving back to pick up armies at our rear planets I check
the enemy planets to see how many armies they have defending. This
really saves a lot of time when you know where you are going at
same moment as when you have picked up.
</p>

<p>
When the enemies are getting down to less than 6 planets and you see
that your team has a advantage, its time to choose the enemies LPS.
This can of course be determined earlier but its hard sometimes to
take exactly those planets that you want. The LPS should not be the
enemy homeworld or a fuel planet if it can be avoided, the further
away from the homeworld the better. Why? you might ask. First, all
killed enemy ships start close to the homeworld which makes it very
hard to get, second dont leave them a fuel planet where they can
refuel their empty tanks.
</p>

<p>
When an enemy carrier has taken a planet and you arrive 2 seconds too
late to do anything about it (and you're carrying yourself) there is 
a trick that might work. Fly at maxwarp against the enemy planettaker
as if you are about to ogg him, cloak when you get into the same
screen as him. This might scare him away from the planet and then you
quickly reduce your speed move in and take the planet before he knows
that he's been cheated. 
</p>


<h2 id="ogging">Ogging</h2>
<p>
<b>Ship:</b>
Chosing the ship is a little depending on the target, I mostly use
the cruiser (CA) because it's torps and phasor are more powerful
than the destroyer (DD). SCs are really neat to ogg with too but then
you have to use a little different tactic.
</p>

<p>
<b>Timing:</b>
Picking the time and opportunity is 50% of the ogg. Usually the best
time is when the person has his mind at other things, like dogfighting
or picking up armies.
</p>

<p>
<b>Conducting (with CA):</b>
If there is no real hurry I pick my target and move to a spot that
isn't too far away from him, then I wait for the right time to move
in. Then I cloak and move in at him at maxwarp, if I see that he
hasn't spotted me (he's not fleeing) I keep at maxwarp just until
before I uncloak. Then when uncloaking I get him with my tractorbeam
and hit him with the phasor and torps. Remember to 'det' his incoming 
torps this will get you the last inch all the way in on him, this to 
get him in your explosion if you havent got him already.
</p>

<p>
If he sees me while I'm moving in and he starts moving away I slow
to warp 4-5, this to make me able to dodge his torps. I then chase
him down while switching between maxwarp and warp 4-5. Keep a good
look at your fuel, you have to have about 2000 left to be able to
finish the ogg.
</p>

<p>
<b>Conducting (with SC):</b>
The SC ogger has to be more patient, the best time to ogg in a SC is
when the taker is just about to start orbiting. Hang around the planet
he's about to take (Stay cloaked and circle at low-medium speed) and
when he moves in to take your rush in and kill him. If you're a bit
lucky the escorts will blow you up on him as well
</p>

<p>
Another good opportunity to SC ogg a taker is when your defenders have 
scared him off from a take and are chasing him back towards his core
your approach him from the opposite direction as his persuers and you
will be able to catch him a bit off guard or without fuel.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hints:</b>
Sometimes I chose just to neutralize a player that I know is carrying
by just keeping track of him and whenever he moves to the left to 
find a way through I move to the left flank cutting him off etc etc.
Sooner or later he gets careless and might gamble and go for a planet
anyway and then he's all yours. 
</p>


<h2 id="baseogging">Baseogging</h2>
<p>
When ogging a starbase you will probably need the whole team or a
large part of it. The key to a successful baseogg is coordination
and determination.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coordination:</b>
The best thing is to use the message line and call for a baseogg,
like: "get in position for a baseogg sync with Rf". Then its the
player Rf that calls the ogg, when he cloakes and moves in so does
does all the others. It's really important that the player that
is leading the ogg waits for all to get in position, if the timing
is really good and enough oggers get through the base will probably
be at warp 1 or maybe even dead.
</p>

<p>
<b>Conducting:</b>
I use 2 different tactics when ogging a base, either I conduct a
ordinary ogg, uncloak, tractor, phasor and torps or I try to get
all the way into the base (ontop of him) and then uncloak. By doing
the latter you will surely get him in your full explosion (100 pts
of damage) plus any torps/phasors you can fire before you die.
</p>

<p>
Repeat the coordination and conducting phases until the base is dead.
If the defence around the base gets too thick there might be a good
idea to abort the ogg, there is no point in giving away kills unless
you can get through to the base.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hints:</b>
There is always a good idea if your team combine the ogg with 1 or
2 plinkers, this to keep the base attention on other things than the
strategic map.
</p>

<p>
Do not lock on to the base when you're about to ogg, your ship will
automagically slow down as to dock (even tho it's an enemy ship) and
you might not get all the way into the base because of that.
</p>


<h2 id="basedefense">Basedefense</h2>
<p>
As a basedefender you have to be real observant for cloaked enemy
ships and be quite handy with the phasor and you have to be willing
to sacrifice yourself for the base.
</p>

<p>
<b>Positioning:</b>
I want my defender to be at my side or at one of the sides just infront
of me. This will enable me to use the pressor/tractor on him
so I can dodge torps and he can help me 'det' a few torps  now and
then. The worst thing is people hiding behind the base thinking its
some kind of undestructable fortress.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ships:</b>
When playing as a basedefender you have to be careful with your
fuel consumption, I try to fly the cruiser (CA) or destroyer (DD)
because they have a better fuel recoverance rating than a battleship (BB). 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hints:</b>
If the base is really hurt you can help him by towing him towards
a homeplanet so he can repair.
</p>

<p>
If you stay real close to the base you can help him 'det' enemy
torps when he's getting ogged, the hard thing with this is to avoid
blowing up on your base.
</p>

<p>
As soon as you get the chance refuel at the base (if you need it)
and always try to have full fueltanks before each new oggwave.
</p>

<p>
Try to have a few players breaking up the wave a bit ahead of the base,
instead of just sitting at the base and wait for them, a combination
of both seem to work best.
</p>


<h2 id="bombing">Bombing</h2>
<p>
<b>Tactics:</b>
I prefer to look at bombing as 'initial' and 'non-initial'. The initial
bombing is the first stage in a new game when your side has to
bomb all the enemy planets, the planets will then contain around 30
enemy armies or so (this might vary from server to server). The non-initial 
bombing is the continous bombing that occurs during a game, 
where the purpose is to keep the enemy planets clean from armies.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ship:</b>
This is the part when it comes to personal preferences and of course
the time in the game. In the initial phase of the game I play the
assaultship (AS) mostly because of its excellent bombing capability,
but also because when the enemy planets have close to 30 armies it
hurts to be orbiting. 
</p>

<p>
After all the enemy planets have been bombed its time to switch to 
the non-initial bombing tactic, this is when your team has 1 person
dedicated as a lone bomber keeping the enemy short of armies. At 
this stage I fly the scoutship (SC), its great speed makes it perfect
for the job. When playing the SC bomber role try to keep away from 
the enemy ships, your role is to bomb NOT to give away kills to the 
other team.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hints:</b>
When moving in to bomb a planet cloak, the reason for this is the
same as when taking planets, you don't want enemy ships to pull you
out of orbit when you are bombing.
</p>

<p>
When playing the scout-bomber be smart and use the scouts great
speed and maneuvrability to feint your opponents. Pretend to be
heading for one planet (you are cloaked of course) and then when the
defenders come racing, switch direction and move to the alternative
target and bomb it. Then when they come at you again you do the same
thing again, staying out of the enemies tractor range is critical.
</p>

<p>
The same sneak tactics apply to bombing as those to planettaking, 
cloak and feint your opponents. Be smart don't give away kills just
to bomb that extra army unless the other team is real short of armies.
If they have no armies they can have all the kills in the
world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Note)</b> When defending armies at your own rear planets you have to
take care of that enemy scout, either by just controling the space
and not letting him bomb or by ogging him. The ogging part is pretty
easy, the key is to get him in your tractor beam. As soon you get
him in the tractor start phasoring him to death, don't waste fuel
on torps because they will surely miss. Remember to 'det' his torps
when you are ogging him. 
</p>


<h2 id="basing">Basing</h2>
<p>
When playing a starbase you can be a asset to your team or a pain in
the ass. The worst thing is a base that needs 3+ permanent defenders
all the time and still needs to go and repair every now and then,
all you do then is occupy a slot in your team and are more a burden
to the team than an asset. A good baseplayer should be able to manage 
with 1 defender, unless he's beeing heavily ogged.
</p>

<p>
<b>Positioning:</b>
I have seen everything from bases "idling" in the core to real frontline 
bases, what is best can probably be debated for years. I think
the base helps the team better if he plays an aggressive role, I try
to place myself at the middle planet of our frontline together with 1
defender. There I can help my team with refueling, refitting and spacecontrol.
</p>

<p>
<b>Plinkage:</b>
This can be really annoying for a base, this is when your defender(s)
are really useful. Use your tractor and pressor beam on your defending
ships (of course you can use enemy ships as well), this combined with 
your warp 2 will really help you in dodging those torps.
</p>

<p>
If you are under heavy plinkage (2 or more ships) it hurts to be 'detting'
all the incoming torps, sometimes it might be better to suck a
few torps rather than to 'det' them all. Try to 'det' the first torps
at maximum range, this might open up a hole in the torpstream and then
dodge through, all this depends on the situation.
</p>

<p>
Don't get too engrossed in dodging plinkers so that you miss the 4
cloaked oggers coming in at you, keep a good look at the strategic
map.
</p>

<p>
<b>Oggers:</b>
When playing starbase you have to keep a good look at the other team
to see if they are preparing for a baseogg, and if so call upon your
defenders before its too late. There are some signs that might help
you in predicting when a baseogg is imminent. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>If the enemy team are killflat (or almost).</li>
<li>You notice that the enemy SC has stopped bombing and are sorta "waiting"
    instead of bombing.</li>
<li>There are enemy ships spread out in a nice semi-circle around you.</li>
<li>When a large part of the enemy team are cloaking at the same time
    near you (at this time its probably too late).</li>
</ul>

<p>
First when you are under heavy ogging the most important thing is to
NEVER get wtemped, if you do get wtemp you have probably used the phasor
and plasma too freqvently. I try not to fire the phasor unless
I'm pretty sure that I'll hit something.
</p>

<p>
I try to keep a neverending stream of torps in the air all the time
this to help my defenders to find the cloaked vessel before he gets
too close. This combined with a few plasmas is usually enough to get
2-3 of the oggers out of business. 
</p>

<p>
Then when the first enemy ship uncloaks I hit him with the pressor, 
this will give me higher speed and make it harder for the others to 
hit me with their torps, and of course I don't want his explosion all 
over me. 
</p>

<p>
Now the hard part begins, try not to panic and phasor at the closest 
enemy and detting all that is fired at you, keep firing at the other 
nearby cloaks while dodging or detting the pressored enemy torps 
(I never said basing was easy). All of the above depends on how syncronized
the oggers are, if they are really synced you will take a 
serious beating no matter how good you are. The important thing is 
to survive the first wave so that you can get more defenders there to 
defend you. Remember to send distress to your team so that they can 
see your status if you're hurt.
</p>

<p> 
<b>Hints:</b>
Even tho the starbase is the most powerful ship and can take a real
beating, be cautious and dont go too deep into enemy space unless you
have defenders at your side. It's been so many times that I've seen 
a good base get plinked to death in enemy space after his defenders
got blown away. Ie know your limits.
</p>

<p>
Help damaged teammates by tractoring them out of danger and by letting
them repair at you. Dont do this unless you're sure that you wont get
him blown up all over you.
</p>

<p>
Don't steal kills from the other players of your team, you can't do
anything with your kills so let the other players get the kill instead.
</p>


<h2 id="general">General questions</h2>
<p>
<b>Q)</b> When playing a LPS-game, Why shouldn't I bomb AGRI planets close 
   to my own LPS/homeworld? (this is within reason, if the planet
   has 8+ armies bomb it down to somewhere around 5-7 armies)
<br />
<b>A)</b> Because when your last planet pops you will get 1-3 armies, then 
   you should bomb the closest planets with a assaultship (AS) and 
   try to get them down to 1-3 armies defending, then you can take 
   the planet even tho you had so few armies. If you bomb continously
   the AGRI planets will pop back up to 4 armies in no time.
<br />
<b>Note)</b> This goes for the offensive side as well, pick up armies of the
   planets closest to your enemies, this to prevent them from bombing
   the planet to less that 4 armies. In this case it doesnt matter if 
   you get killed while carrying.
</p>

<p>
<b>Q)</b> How do I know if a player with kills have picked up armies or not?
<br />
<b>A)</b> First, if you look at the strategic map and see a player with 
   kills orbiting one of his own planets with armies its a pretty sure sign
   that he has picked up armies. The best way tho is to keep track of
   those players that has kills and check the armies at planet he's 
   moving to with 'i' then you see if he's picking up or not. Ships that
   pickup armies also tend to blink at the galactic when they pickup.
<br />
<b>Note)</b> Set your galactic and tactical map to show resources.
</p>

<p>
<b>Q)</b> how do I get phasor lock on cloaked players?
<br />
<b>A)</b> The key is the strategic map, set the galatic updates to 'frequently' 
   then when you get the update (the ships move on the galactic) you 
   phasor at the cloaker. 
<br />
   I used to phasor at the galactic screen but I had trouble moving 
   the cursor back to the tactical screen and maintain the lock. So 
   now I watch the galactic for the update and phasor at the tactical
   and that seem to work really well now.
</p>

<p>
<b>Q)</b> Why should i help anyone else in my team, it doesnt give me any
   DI?
<br />
<b>A)</b> The team that plays together and help eachother will win in the
   end. If you help other players you will soon find that they will
   come to your aid when you need it. DI-scummers will get less and
   less help and in the end he wont get any help at all.
<br />
<b>Note)</b> I have seen teams with several high ranked players play as    
   individuals and lose BIG. Keep your team together and use the
   team message-line to communicate and you will win.
