# Outdated definitions:
# Barren [Hunter Chen]: No armies (duh, ;))
# Borg scum / Client Scum: People who play borgs during non-borg hours or on non-borg servers. [Walter D. Pullen] Someone who uses borg clients on non-client nights. At least most of these are from Berkley. Most popular are plasma clients and phaser clients. I think its pretty clear that these people are cheating. [Hugh More]  This is now very uncommon due to the RSA verification scheme, which was designed specifically to prevent this.[Shekter]
# Cyborg: see borg.
# Grey Elf effect: To suddenly dodge into a stream of torps. He named it himself. [Timothy Worsley] Also called the Pac Man Effect or Wocka Wocka Wocka Effect.
# Wocka Wocka Wocka: Pac Man effect of eating enemys torps without detting. Also labelled as the Grey Elf Effect. [Hunter Chen] 
# Lawyers: Armies.
# Phaser Scum: people who, at every opportunity, will try to prove that Phasers are superior to torps and plasma, and who will was an entire ships worth of fuel chasing a phasering a scout . [Thomas Smith]


!kcamS: "Smack!" backwards, you get to say this when you phaser somebody's plasma right in his face as they fire it.
++: Carrying, e.g. "R9++". More or fewer plusses represent an exact knowledge of number of armies. [Timothy Worsley] [Coined by Randy Dean]
ACC: Actual carriers created. A stat tracked by the INL servers, this is how many times you gave someone a kill that they then used to pick up armies. [Developed by Mark Noworolski]
AGRI: An Agricultural planet. Most clients show these with their names all in capitals. Strategically very important. Compare to "Rock".
ASW: Anti-Scout Warfare, i.e. harrassment of the enemy scout bomber. A.k.a. anti-bombing.
Borg: A netrek client that has some sort of automatic "cheat" feature, e.g. auto-dodge or phaser, cloaker display, etc. This is cheating (except on servers which explicitly allow it). [Perhaps named after Fil Alleva's character]
Bot: Practice robot, or third space robot, or terminator.
Bronco server: Bronco-type servers, such as CMU, Berekeley, USC, and UofW. Differs from Chaos servers in refuel and plasmas. No Galaxiy class ships. [Hunter Chen] This is what is now the standard Netrek server, so named becuase it first appeared on a machine called bronco. [Shekter]
Bronco-type server: A.k.a. vanilla servers, these are ordinary netrek servers such as continuum.us.netrek.org or pickled.psychosis.com. Servers with small mods such as bigbang.astro.indiana.edu and calvin.usc.edu are considered bronco-type too, except by the purists. But definitely not Paradise servers, Chaos servers, Hockey servers, Dogfight servers, or Sturgeon (upgrade) servers. Named after bronco.ece.cmu.edu, a now-defunct server run by the great Terence Chang.
Buttorp: To fire torpedoes out the rear of one's ship while running. While this is a fun and easy way to waste someone who insists on chasing you, doing this habitually makes you a Runner Scum. [Shekter]
Chain reaction: The explosion of one ship killing a nearby teammate's ship, and so forth.
Chaos server: Modified Bronco server with high refuel rates, free plasmas, and Galaxy classes. Also known as Galaxy server. [Hunter Chen] These are pretty rare these days.[Shekter]
Chung: To kill oneself by firing plasma point-blank at the wall. If you carry armies, most servers give you DI for this, and in any case it denies the kill to enemies. Named after Greg Chung, pioneer of this dubious tactic, who will never forgive me putting this entry here.
Clear: To kill the defenders of a planet, so that a teammate (following close behind) can bomb or take it.
Clear kills: To aggressively get rid of most enemies with kills, independent of whether they carry or not. This is to prevent having to track too many potential enemy carriers and helps you focus on fewer targets. [Erik Hietbrink]
Clue: Basic grasp of strategy, Netrek playing ability, experience, etc. Also someone who has these, e.g. Tywong is clue. [Shekter] There's a critical paradigm shift between non-clue and clue. Beginners tend to see all enemy ships as targets: things to fight, to destroy.  In contrast, clue tend to view places as targets, with enemy ships as obstacles - things to go around or shove out of the way so you can get to where you want to go.  Once a player sees the game in terms of places to go and obstacles in the way, they understand a lot of how netrek works, especially once they recognize planets as the usual places. It's a short hop from there to space control tactics, useful both in defense and escort. [Andrew Markiel]
Clueless: A generally derogatory term referring to a players inability to match to expected levels of play either due to lack of experience or poor ability. [Hunter Chen]
Core planets: Usually refers to the homeworld and four nearest planets of each system. However, the server has its own idea of what a core world is, which it uses to award double planet DI to an enemy who takes one, namely the homeworld and three of the four nearest planets. Alp, Hyd, Lyr, and Her are not core for this purpose.
Cripple: A player that is damaged significantly, so that with his low top speed he basically becomes either a sitting duck or a useless observer. Which of the two depends on the game situation. Especially when your team is ahead you want to cripple the good enemy players rather than kill them. That way they will not spawn with a fresh ship at your destination. [Erik Hietbrink]
Damage Control: This is something that's very hard to do, especially if you're a new player. Since a ship repairs BOTH its hull and shield at the same time it's really beneficial to be able to take some damage in the hull and the rest on the shield. The really hard thing is to figure out HOW much damage you can allow on the hull since damage to your hull lowers your maxwarp as well. Of course damage control in the smaller ships, DD, SC is questionable, I've never done it in any other ships than the CA, BB and SB. A.k.a. Damage splitting. [Jan Sandorf]
Cut: Make a sharp turn, especially to go to take a different planet than the one you had been headed for.
DI scum: Similar to ratings scum, these people either only play during the initial bombing runs, or else quit out near the end of the game when there are no more chances for lots of bombing and planet taking. [Walter Pullen]
DI: According to the authors, DI is "Destruction Inflicted". It is simply your (planets+bombing+offense) ratings x (Tmode hours). Note that it is possible to lose DI because your ratings are always relative to the global average. To achieve a given rank, you must accumulate a certain amount of DI before going over some number of hours. Or you can get promotions on double DI or quad DI with lesser ratings but more hours. [Terence Chang]
DI: According to the authors, DI is Destruction Inflicted.It is simply your (planets+bombing+offense) ratings x (Tmode hours). When you a receive a promotion on DI, it means that you could sit around and do nothing while waiting for the required number of hours and still get the promotion. E.g., Admiral Flatliner has only 27.19 hours while 40 hours and a ratings total of 8 are required for the rank. 8 x 40 = 320 DI. Flatliners ratings add up to 11.69, so 27.19 x 11.69 ~= 320. Note that it is possible to lose DI because your ratings are always relative to the global average The double DI and quad DI promotions are fairly meaninglessbasically you can get a promotion with insufficient ratings but lots of hours. [Terence Chang] 
DL: Draft League. A semi-professional Netrek league with regular games. This requires less clue to play in than the INL. [Shekter]
Decoy: Fly deep into enemy space, perhaps cloaked, pretending to be a planet-taker, for the sole purpose of drawing enemy attention to oneself (and away from teammates). Ben Peal calls this the Magna Doodle tactic. A variant is the Rob Hill Memorial Decoy, where you do this while carrying armies just in case you get through.
Deep Bombing: Bombing deep in enemy teritory. This often involves cloaking, and is very important at the begining of the game. [Hugh More]
Det: To detonate torpedos. [Timothy Worsley]
Doosh: To kill an important carrier who is carrying a reasonable number of armies. Any kill of a base that has been effective in gameplay is a doosh, whether the base was carrying armies or not. There are some other odd spots where doosh applies. Any particularly large display of carnage (such as two fleets meeting at a planet and going up in an 8-ship chain explosion) certainly qualify. Also, even if a starbase were very weak and innefective, any base ogg where 6-7 ships uncloaked simultaneously from well-spread angles such that it is very clear that the base hasnt got a snowballs chance in hell, is quite clearly a Doosh! [Jon Blow]
Empire: Netrek's ancestor, started in 1972 on the PLATO network. Pioneered the four races, phasers, torps, shields, tractors, pressors, and many other things that are at the core of netrek. 
Ensign Clueless: A special term to denote those players who don't really know how to play very well, but help their teams greatly by being at the right place at the right time. These guys can really help Oggers and planet taker by distracting opponents and often serve to scare off runner scum who would be taking planets. [Hugh More (ZZnew guy)]
Ensign scum: Good players who log in as guest or a new Ensign character so people will think they are clueless, until they promptly get wasted. Especially fun to do against the Newbie scum, below. [Walter Pullen]
Escort: To protect a carrier (or sometimes a starbase), either by preceding the carrier on the way to the target planet in order to get enemies out of the way, or by meeting up at the target. Escorts need to be between the carrier and its enemies, which usually means in front.
Fake: In the context of planet taking, making a feint towards a planet, fully intending to cut to a different one when the defenders react.
Faker scum: People who do things like fly their SB at warp 1 when its not damaged, or pretend to be damaged so you'll chase them and they can waste you. [Walter Pullen]
Fed: Short for Federation. It is the name of one of the four races in Netrek. The others are Kli(ngons), Ori(ons) and Rom(ulons). The homeworld of the Federation is Earth.
Fire-hose: Orbit a fuel world and fire continuous streams of torpedos. [Coined by Bean Peal]
Flat: A planet is flat when it has four armies or fewer. See also kill-flat.
Fly casual: Fly carrying armies in the same manner you would if not carrying.
Free beer: Someone who is consistently easy to kill.
Front line: The line of contention. E.g. in a close Fed-Rom battle, the Romulan front is Cap-Ind-Reg and the Fed front is Rig-Can-Org.
Giving away kills: Giving the enemy kills is bad, of course, but this term is also applied to teammates, especially starbases, who wound enemies and hold them, allowing a teammate who can better use the kill to "steal" it.
God: The server god is the person who set up and controls the server. He or She has great power but seldom if ever uses it.
Hard-take: Effectively take and reinforce all in one trip. As opposed to taking a planet but leaving it at 1 army.
Hero of Core: Someone who hides in his own core, ratio-scumming, sometimes retaking nearby planets, and talking trash.
Hitler: Scum who log in specifically to hurt a team, and so help the opposing side. This can involve giving away kills, going in as their SB and letting the enemy kill it (along with 25 armies), telling the other side whos carrying, along with other nasty things. [Walter D. Pullen] A player who comes in on the other side in order to hurt them and then quits out again and rejoins his old team. [Hugh More (ZZnew guy)]
Hockey: There are many variants of Netrek. The "standard" is called Bronco. The Hockey variant is Netrek adapted to play like ice hockey. Often described as the most fun you can have on ice without actually being on it. Teams of players try to shoot (pressor) the Puck (a robot) into the other teams' goal. Hockey however, is difficult and should not be attempted by very new netrek players.
Hork: To steal someone's kill is to get the kill with one phaser or a couple long-range torps after your teammate did the hard work. To steal someone's planet is similar, e.g. he used 4 armies to destroy it, and you just drop 1 and get all the DI. Both are perfectly fine instances of teamwork, but some people care about their stats.
Hoser: Practice robot. Also a derogatory term.
Hotel: Or Army Motel: the armies check in but they don't check out. A player who carries a lot of armies around for a long time and never manages to use them..
Human Target: A battleship Ogg done without cloaking at warp 8 in order to clear space. Named after Hugh Moores ship of the same name. [Timothy Worsley]
INL server: Bronco-vanilla server set up for timed games. Games are normally 60 minutes, with a 15 minute sudden-death overtime, where the victory condition is owning at least 11 planets with the opponents owning no more than 8. Planets start at 17 armies. Ensigns can starbase. One player on each team gets captain's privileges, allowing him to start the game, pause it, etc.
INL: International Netrek League. A professional Netrek league. INL players and INL games are generally considered to be the ultimate in Netrek clue. [Shekter]
Iggy: Practice robot. So named because it is often the player designated by Ig (Player in slot g, on the Independent team.)
Kids: Armies. (I know there is an origin, but Im not sure what it is.) [Timothy Worsley] 
Kill scum: People who only play to rack up kills and don't do anything with them to help their team. They are often found hanging around the SB or around a last planet where they can easily rack up kills. [Walter D. Pullen]
Kill-flat: A team is kill-flat when they have no ship with a kill, other than perhaps their starbase. Often abbreviated with KF.
KF: Kill-flat. A team is kill-flat when they have no ship with a kill, other than perhaps their starbase.
Kli: Short for Klingons. It is the name of one of the four races in Netrek. The others are Fed(eration), Ori(ons) and Rom(ulons). Further Kli can also stand for the Klingon homeworld, Klingus, as used in "Bomb Kli @ 6".
LPS: Last Planet Stand. If the enemy is down to a few planets, its useful to try to get the hardest ones first (like the home planet) while they are still uncertain which planet youre planning to take: i.e. you can fake an attack on a different planet in hopes of drawing away some defenders. If it gets down to an LPS on the hardest planet, its much harder to take since the enemy knows exactly where youre going. [Andrew Markiel]
Loaded: Carrying many armies (typically 5 or more).
Meatballs: Plasma torpedos. 
Message scum: People who send nasty or insulting messages to individuals or teams to intimidate or scroll their screen so they can't read useful stuff. Especially applies to those robots. [Walter Pullen]
MUCUS PIG: A former CMU player famed for being highly skilled and very verbally abusive.
Mutual: Kill and be killed (usually in your victim's explosion). 
Name scum: Similar to Ensign scum, people who play under a different name then they are accustomed to. Often involves switching terminals with a teammate to confuse the enemy or give an advantage. E.g. a good dogfighter gets a kill and switches terminals with the team planet taker. [Walter Pullen]
Newbie scum: Merciless players who target Ensigns and other newbies and waste them several times to rack up kills so they can do whatever. [Walter Pullen]
Newbie: Beginner; One who has just started playing netrek. [Hunter Chen]
Offensive Tackle: See Human Target. Named for Jon Kims ship of the same name. [Timothy Worsley]
Nettrek: Nettrek (with two T's) is a game for the Macintosh that is a kind of cousin to Netrek, being also descended from Empire and written in the mid-1980s.It works over the LocalTalk LAN system. Since LocalTalk is long obsolete, this doesn't really get played anymore. 
Ogg: Og....The act of Ogging. The process of cloaking and appearing adjacent to enemy while firing torps and tractoring on to him. Purpose: To kill. Without caring about dying in the process, also called suiciding. Ogging is an art, it consists of knowing when to cloak and when to uncloak. Planets are not subject to Ogging, since no one can here their screams.[Bert Enderton] Suicide, Kamikaze. Attack a ship without caring about dying in the process. Especially, a cloaked approach to an enemy carrier or starbase.  Back in, I believe, November/December of 1990 I use to play netrek much more than now. At the time, I was probably only Flt Captain Sun Tzu, maybe even just a Captain. A group of us, which included Jay Hui (TheSlug), Byron Sinor (Krang), and Steve Russel (Khelik) were playing netrek with Terence. The three of us were Feds, Terence was Orion. It was a full game, and Terence had come in as Og &lt;== (beginning to get how it happened :&gt; ). At this time, suiciding people with kills *NEVER* happened. Dogfighting rained supreme, and cloaking was used only for planet taking, that is until Terence decided to teach us CMU boys alesson. Steve had accumulated a 3, 4 kill ship and had taken Spica (or El Nath, I don't remember) and Terence chased him and tried to mutual with him. Steve killed him, but was left at ~90% internal. As he wiggled towards Fed. space he watched the galactic map as Og reappeared and began to move rapidly in his direction. I will never forget how his voice shattered the calm of the cluster with yells of Its OGGGGGGGG. HELP! HELP!!!!!!!!! Its OOOOOOGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!. His final words were something to the effect of AAAAAAAAAArrrrrrrgggggghhhhhh, Ive been Ogged!!. Jay and I immediately picked up on the effectiveness of suiciding people, and had Terence show us how to do it better. That is how Ogging started getting popular, and how the name spread through Netrek History. [Kevin Bernatz] 
Ogger Scum: Those who Ogg for no understandable reason. This does not include those who occationally Ogg planet takers with kills, bombers, and star bases. However, there are people who Ogg people with no kills, and people who never take planets simply because its the only way they can see anyone blow up other than themselves. [Hugh More (ZZnew guy)]
Open side: As opposed to the wall side. The region near the planets facing 3rd space. E.g. in a Fed-Rom war, the Federation's open-side planets are Beta, Ceti, and Organia.
Open: A (sometimes momentarily) undefended planet.
Ori: Short for Orions. It is the name of one of the four races in Netrek. The others are Fed(eration), Kli(ngons) and Rom(ulons). Further Ori can also stand for the Orion's homeworld, Orion, as used in "Bomb Ori @ 6".
Ping-pong plasma: On some Sturgeon servers, plasma torpedos work differently that usual. Usually, you can just phaser them and they are gone. With ping-pong plasma, phasoring makes the plasma bounce back towards the ship that fired it. They can then phasor it, causing it to bounce back the other way, and so on. 
Pinwheel: To orbit a fuel planet firing strings of torps. Often not as good an idea as it seems, since the orbiting ship is a pretty easy target, and has no momentum to use for dodging.
POG: 
PWstats: Stats calculated by INL servers after the game. PW stands for Passing Wind, the character played by INL server hacker Mark Noworolski. They are: tpt (total planets taken), tpd (total planets destroyed), tpb (total planets bombed),  (total armies bombed), tac (total armies carried), pad (percent armies delivered), fao (friendly armies ogged), eao (enemy armies ogged), tof (normalized average distance to enemy homeworld), eck (enemy carries killed), pck (potential carriers killed), tek (total enemies killed), fck (friendly carriers killed), def (deaths by enemy fire), and acc (actual carriers created).
TPT: Total planets taken. One of the statistics for INL games.
TPD: Total planets destroyed. One of the statistics for INL games.
TPB: Total planets bombed. One of the statistics for INL games.
TAB: Total armies bombed. One of the statistics for INL games.
TAC: Total armies carried. One of the statistics for INL games.
PAD: Percent armies delivered. One of the statistics for INL games.
FAO: Friendly armies ogged. One of the statistics for INL games.
EAO: Enemy armies ogged. One of the statistics for INL games.
TOF: Total offense. Normalized average distance to enemy homeworld. One of the statistics for INL games.
ECK: Enemy carries killed. One of the statistics for INL games.
PCK: Potential carriers killed. These are enemies killed who had kills for more than 30 seconds. They could have picked armies and thus were potential carriers. One of the statistics for INL games.
TEK: Total enemies killed. One of the statistics for INL games.
FCK: Friendly carriers killed. One of the statistics for INL games.
DEF: Deaths by enemy fire. One of the statistics for INL games.
Pac Man Fever: To suddenly dodge into a stream of torps. You know, eating the dots. [Scott Drellishak]
Peace scum: Players who declare peace against the opposing team so they can fuel off of enemy planets. A worthwhile technique, but can have bizarre results when players on both teams are doing it.
Phaser lock: Hit a cloaker with a phaser, thus determining the cloaker's position.
Phaser: Sometimes also referred to as "lines" (versus "dots" = torps). A phaser is one of the primary weapons of your starship. Its range is limited so it can only be used in close combat. Its destructive force increases lineary with the decrease in distance. The additional advantage of a phaser over torps is that your opponent cannot dodge a phaser. It shoots instantly (of course taking in account the communications delay). Classic battles between Phasers and Torps have proven that the phaser is the superior weapon of the two. [Erik Hietbrink]
Pig Call: Originally implemented to identify if someone was using a Borg client, most notoriously the "Pig" borg. If anyone sends a message consisting of five space characters as a message, the receiving clients will answer back with their client and version information.
Pig: A Borg client written my Tod Mummert. Also, any player who uses this client. Named after MUCUS PIG. [Timothy Worsley]
Ping-pong plasma: Normally a player can hit an incoming plasma torpedo with his phaser and make it explode. However, with ping-pong plasma's, the plasma will instantly reverse direction and lock onto the enemy team. On top of that its lifetime will increase as well as the damage it will do. Currently the only server with Ping-pong plasma enabled is nl.netrek.org [Erik Hietbrink]
Pizza scum: A player who takes up a slot, normally cloaked, while eating, going to the bathroom etc. [Timothy Worsley]
Planet Hork: An enemy gets killed by planetary fire just before you could get the kill yourself. Basically the planet stole the kill after you did all the hard work fighting and damaging the enemy ship.
Planet Scum: A sub-group of Ratings Scum. Those who waste armies by dumping them on planets that can't be defended in order to improve their planet ratings. This can acutally help the team if they have a lot of armies or are against a clueless opponent. Often, however, it hurts the team because the planets are quickly recaptured and the armies are lost for good. [Hugh More]
Planet scum: Sometimes used derogatively to indicate someone who is just trying to improve their planet rating without thinking of his team's welfare. (E.g. someone who takes an enemy core world for the double DI when he could have taken a more strategic planet instead.) But normally just refers to someone trying to take planets.
Plasma Scum: Some one who devotes their game play to getting plasma and keeping it (i.e. never dying). They stay near a fuel planet and just plasma anyone who comes near. Really obnoxious dorks to have on your team. [Ellis ?]
Plasma scum: Anyone using plasma, especially if that seems to be their main goal.
Plink: Lob torpedos (at) from long range.
Plock: Short for "phaser lock". (Instantly) hitting a cloaked enemy ship with your phaser.
Pop: When a planet grows armies. [Timothy Worsley]
Pops: Armies
Pregnant: Carrying armies. [Timothy Worsley]
Quitter scum: Someone who quits out when facing certain death, to avoid giving the enemy a kill (and the satisfaction thereof). If there's no wait queue, the quitter scum can quickly re-enter, so this is occasionally a clever ploy.
RCD: Receiver Configurable Distress. There is a whole section on these in your client manual. 
ROBO effect: Shooting a plasma as soon as it is fired. Some only count this as the ROBO effect if the phasorer is then accused of playing a borg client. [Timothy Worsley]
Rock: A planet with no bonus features; it's not an AGRI, and has no fuel or repair sources. Generally therefore the least important planets to take.
RSA: The encryption alogrithm used in Netrek to prevent people from using borgs. It works like this: each client has its own key, which is in two parts, a public and a private key. The public key is given to all the servers. The private key is hidden in the client binarythis is why clients are distributed only in binary form. When the client connects to the server, the server generates a packet of random data and sends it to the client. The client encrypts this with its private key and sends it back to the server. The server decrypts this with the public key for that client. If the client is what it claims to be, i.e. it has the correct private key, the public key will decrypt the packet back to the original sequence. Its actually somehwat more complex than this, but the net result is that its very difficult to use a borg when you are not supposed to. Even if you do manage to create a blessed borg, the server gods can simply disable the particular key you are using, without causing too much disruption. [Shekter]
Racing: Netrek Racing is a for-fun-only game variant where all players have to fly a pre-determined course. Whoever makes it first to the finish line wins. [Invented by Rakesh Murria]
Rank scum: Players for whom ratings and rank are more important than helping their team. Usually they wind up helping their team by accident anyway.
Ratings scum: General scummy players who only play to make the next rank and don't bother helping their team any. [Walter Pullen]
Ratio Scum: Someone playing for ratio rather than to help their team.[Bert Enderton] Another sub-group of Ratings Scum. Those who are so cautious about dogfighting that they rarely get a chance to do it, but prefer to pick up injured ships. These hurt a team by stealing kills from those who would use them (to take planets) and by filling up a team slot with a more-or-less useless player. Frequenly, star bases are Ratio Scum. [Hugh More]
Redlining: Flying for a long period of time with an e-temp above 95. [Timothy Worsley]
Reinforce: Beam armies onto a planet you already own, e.g. to bring it from 1 army to 3. The symmetric operation is to weaken an enemy planet.
Res(urrection) scum: Kill someone right when he reses, before he gets a chance to move. MUCUS PIG was a master at this, and would taunt his victims afterwards and runner-scum them.[Bert Enderton] People who kill you right when you enter the game. The worst scum of this type can kill you in this manner several times (especially in a borg on needmore) each time you get pissed off and come in to kill the person only to be smashed by a plasma and 8 torps before you can move or fire anywhere. [Walter Pullen] Type II Res scum: Basically the opposite of the above. These people use a shiny new ship or two to take out most anyone near their home planet, i.e. you are beautifully dogfighting, and manage to take out that BB in your DD. Unfortunately you are now going warp 2 and he comes right back in and flies at you in a new CA at warp 9 and your kill quickly becomes his kill. [Walter Pullen]
Res: Resurrect; i.e., re-enter after dying. 
Rewl: Rule. Win dogfights without giving ground. Take up residence at a contested planet and crush all comers. Also as a carrier, beat the defender dogfighting and take the planet.
Robot scum: Players who bring in a 3rd space robot to give them an initial advantage if they get genocided, or else attract the Terminators or Hunterkillers over into enemy space to wreak havoc. [Walter Pullen] [Ellis: since most servers no longer allow bombing out of T, and terminatorsweapons will only hurt the team who fired out of T, and not many servers even have iggy, you wont see this one a lot either.]
Role: A long-term assignment for a particular player. E.g. scout-bomber.
Rom: Short for Romulons. It is the name of one of the four races in Netrek. The others are Fed(eration), Kli(ngons) and Ori(ons). Further Rom can also stand for the Romulon homeworld, Romulus, as used in "Bomb Rom @ 6".
Runner Scum: Berkeley term. 1) This refers to those who run from and even fight in hopes of being chased so that they can gain the advantage of shooting backwards. It is important that this does not include running when outnumbered, injured, or out of fuel. It also does not include merely attemping to stay at rangewhere a smaller ship is more effective. Runner scum are looked down upon because this tactic can't be used by everyone. If it were, there would be no kills. So those who try to make the game more interesting get reamed. 2) also often used to descibe those who hide in the backfield and only fight the occational straggler. [Hugh Moore (ZZnew guy)]
SMACK!: A hit with a plasma torpedo, especially if the ship dies, when it is also a FATALITY, and especially when the ship in question was carrying, in which case it is also a DOOSH! [Ellis]
Scarecrow: A player who stays in a dangerous situation even though he is out of fuel or badly damaged in the hopes of tricking an opponent into wasting time or even running. [Hugh Moore]
Scout bombing: Bombing deep in enemy territory, especially with a scout. The usual idea is to try to stay behind enemy lines and bomb the armies that pop, and to run and/or cripple any enemy who chases you.
SC dropping, Scout dropping: Delivering two armies at a time to random enemy planets, using a scout. This seems to be a particularly powerful plan when one's team is ahead 13-7 or so.
Scum: In the absence of a modifier, to take planets (or someone who does so -- scum can be a verb or a noun).
Scum: Of course I like that one definition I read on this group a while back, that a ___ scum is someone who does ___ more than I do. [Walter Pullen] I should point out that at times, calling someone a &lt;whatever&gt; scum is a compliment. Particularly, Planet Scum and Ogger Scum can often help their teams, and are cheered by thier fellows. [Hugh More]
Shadow: Or shark. Stay near an enemy, without cloaking, far enough to avoid being runner-scummed, but close enough that he or she can't safely orbit a planet.
Shark Ogg: To Ogg, without cloaking, by following a player just outside of effective weapon range, until s/he reaches an obstacle, and then attacking. [Timothy Worsley]
Shuttle: Pick up from planets and drop on the starbase or homeworld.
Sling: What a starbase does to help teammates who want to fly from one side of it to the other; namely, tractor them in and then pressor them out on the other side. (Or on a server which allows this (formerly calvin), to touch a transwarping ship with tractor or pressor beams to bring him out of transwarp without his incurring the five second lock-up.)
Slot scum: Someone who connects but doesn't play. A.k.a pizza scum. This is very bad; slot scummers should be banned. Slot scumming the enemy team to help your real team is out-and-out cheating.
Smack: Hit with a plasma torpedo. Plasma scums seem to like writing SMACK! or :-* to the All board whenever they do this.
Space controlling: As a role, this generally means dogfighting at the front and escorting, point-defending, and dealing with front-line armies as needed.
Split damage: Take 1 point on the hull for every 2 points to the shields. Increases repair efficiency since shields repair twice as fast. A.k.a. Damage Control.
Starbase scum: People who play a SB and try to individually waste anyone that comes near. This involves cloaking and when an enemy comes within range, quickly uncloaking and tractoring it in to its death. Common tactic found most anywhere. I do it all the time. :) [Walter Pullen] [Ellis: of course, the base isnt helping its team at all. Dont do it.]
Stealer scum: Very annoying teammates who steal your kills or planets, e.g. you skillfully wound Flt. Capt. Dodgeswell after a hard dogfight and are about to take him out when some Lieutenant flies in and takes the kill with one phaser, or you use 4 of your armies to neutralize a planet, only to have someone else take it when you are away getting more armies. Generally doesnt apply if they take kills from the SB or take heavily contested planets. [Walter D. Pullen]
Stupid ogging: The strategy of slamming into and mutualling with any enemy ships in one's space. E.g. the Human Target style. A.k.a. offense scumming. 
Surface Bombing: Bombing outside planets, genocided race planets, and other undefended planets. [Hugh More]
Switcher scum: People who switch sides in the middle of a game, often to the more clueful team so they can benefit by a quick genocide. Especially scummy is to log in on one side, and bomb the enemy flat, then quickly switch and bomb the first team flat, to rack up DI. [Walter Pullen]
Synch: Synchronize, e.g. for a starbase og. E.g. "sync on d" means to time your approach so that you reach the target at about the same time as your teammate in the d slot. Many ships synchronized comprise a wave.
T-Mode Scum: The worst slime in the galaxy. These are the people who at 3am log in 4 times on each side as guest, and then come in as their main character and bomb everything and take over the galaxy a few times while they are the only one playing = lots of DI. [Walter Pullen] This is not possible on many servers now, as they check the actual login and IP address of the player to prevent this sort of thing.[Shekter]
Tournament Mode: Server mode when there are at least 4 players on each of two adjacent teams. Without t-mode it's just practice, not a netrek game. Stats are only recorded during T-mode. T-mode shows up as a little T in the flags display. You can only bomb and take planets in T-Mode, so basically if you don't have T-mode you don't have a game (which means you will have a minimum of eight players for a Netrek game.)
T-mode: Tournament Mode.
T: Tournament Mode.
Take: To capture a planet.
Taker: A designated role; one player is assigned to be the primary taker of enemy planets.
TOF: A stat computed by the INL servers, this is proportional to your ship's average distance to the enemy homeworld It's normalized to the rest of your team's distances, with 100 being the average for your team. Generally speaking, low tof is worth striving for. Stands for Total Offense, I think, although that makes no particular sense.
Terminal scum: People who kick you off that nice color xterm because youre playing games and they want to use it to get some work done. [Walter Pullen]
Third Space: The section of the galaxy owned by teams with no players on them, e.g. Orion and Klingon space in a Fed vs. Rom game.
Third space scum: Someone who takes over neutral space rather than working for a genocide. Disallowed by most servers these days.
Traitor: Someone deliberately working against the interests of his own team.
Twink-bashing: Picking on the bad players, e.g. to get kills.
Twink: A bad player, especially one who has been playing a long time and still sucks. Bad doesn't just mean skills; it can be a skilled player who acts like a jerk. 
Type scum: Kill someone who is typing a message. 
Wall side: The region near the galaxy side-wall. E.g. in a Fed-Rom war, Veg Alt Rig Cap Hyd and Ald are considered wall-side planets.
Wave: Ships trying to synchronize an attack, usually in the case of an attempt to ogg a starbase, attempt to arrive as a unified wave. Breaking the wave is an important defensive technique to stop these attacks. 
Xtrek: The immediate predecessor game to Netrek, written at the University of California at Berkeley in 1986. It did not have a network client/server protocol, being based on the unix X-Window display system.
