  >This chapter will discuss dogfighting, one of the major
  aspects of the game. The chapter will be split into paragraphs adressing
  the issues of how to do damage and how to avoid it, a paragraph which tells
  you what not to do and finally some stuff which is related to dogfighting 
  on a higher level. In this manual, the standard shiptype of a CA is assumed. 
  The intricansies of other shiptypes and dogfighting will be discussed in 
  a seperate section. </

  >In netrek there is basically only five ways to deal damage. 
  Phasering, torping, using plasma, detting enemy torps and 
  exploding. Phasering and torping are good options which will 
  be adressed individually. Using plasma is a definite 
  <i>don't</i>, and will be discussed in section (3.1). Detting
  enemy torps is relatively complicated but an essential 
  mechanic of the game and will be discussed in greater detail
  in section (1.2.4). Finally, exploding does a great deal of 
  damage but since it uhm... kills you in the 
  process, it is the least desirable option.

  >So, there is all these ways to deal damage, but the next
  question is <i>how much damage should I deal?</i> To 
  answer that question directly: it all depends on the 
  ships you are facing. Smaller ships need less damage 
  to be killed, heavier ships can take more. No rocket 
  science there. 
 
  For now, assume you will be mostly facing CA's 
  (cruisers) which need a 200 damage to be killed
  (100 shields + 100 hull). Read on, and find out
  how you can rack up that 200 damage...

  Keep one thing in mind when you phaser: the amount of 
  damage you deal with your
  phaser depends on the distance from which you phaser. 
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  Let me run that by you once again. The <b>damage you deal</b>
  with your phaser depends on the <b>distance at which
  you phaser</b>. This means that if you phaser from far away,
  you deal little to no damage, and if you phaser when close, 
  you deal tons of damage.
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  Figure 2 on the right shows the amount of damage dealt for
  different phaser distances. As a general rule of thumb, 
  always phaser when you can deal at least 20 points of 
  damage. <b>Learn</b> that phaser range <b>by heart</b>!

  Once you've tried to phaser, you'll notice that it 
  needs 1 second to 'recharge'. In this time you 
  can not use it. The trick is, to learn how long
  this 1 second actually takes, so you can immediately
  use it again after it has 'recharged'. Believe me,
  you want to be phasering every second if you get 
  the chance, because that will bring you one step 
  closer to your ultimate goal... humiliating your 
  opponents in dogfights.

  >One of the mistakes beginners typically make, is shooting torps in 
  a straight line at their opponent. As you can see in Figure 3, it is
  relatively easy for <b>O1</b> to dodge the torps. There is only one special 
  situation in which shooting a line of torps is warranted, and that is 
  when you 'buttorp'. This is one of the things you generally don't want
  to be doing, so you can read all about it in (4.1.3).
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  The best way to make your torps hit is to fire them in clouds (Figure 
  4). For firing a dense cloud like that keyrepeat is almost 
  essential, however. You might do without keyrepeat, but 
  make sure you click those buttons at lightning speed.  
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  The destructive thing about torp clouds is that they are a) hard to 
  dodge, and b) impossible to det. Dodging is hard because any
  way you move, there will always be some outer-torp hitting.
  Detting is difficult because the torps 'surround' you
  in no-time and pressing det at that time, will det them all, and
  hence kill you on the spot.</font></TD>

  Torping in clouds is one thing, but knowing <i>when</i> to 
  torp is another. You will notice that unlike the 
  phaser which <b>always</b> hits, torps need time to 
  arrive at their destination, e.g.: your opponent. And
  this is exactly the weakness of using torps as your
  main weapon: your opponent has time to <i>dodge</i> them.
  To reduce the chance that your opponent will have the time
  to dodge your torps, make sure you fire your torps when 
  you are within 20 point phaser range (as shown previously 
  in fig. 2).

  One of the major discussions in netrek is called
  "lines vs. dots". It basically comes down to the
  question: 
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  <i>What is better: phasering or torping?</i>
  <BR><BR>
  To answer the question on the spot: phasers. They
  <b>always</b> hit, and do <b>tremendous damage</b>
  when used within close range. Torps have this 
  weakness which is called uhm... <b>dodging</b>.

  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  When you play, focus on your phasers. Use them.
  Then remember about torps: they do damage.
  Lots of damage if you use them in a smart way.

  Now here comes the real deal, the real treat, 
  the real secret to winning dogfights and I'll call
  it <b>the phaser cycle</b>. 
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  Remember, that phasers are by far the most superior
  weapons since they always hit and do lots of damage 
  at close range.
  Their only drawback is the 1-second 'recharging time'.
  Keeping this in mind and having practiced a little,
  you should always be phasering every second, because
  hey, those are <b>guaranteed</b> hits, and hey, you
  want to be dealing the <b>most</b> damage in 
  the <b>shortest</b> timespan possible.
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  Now, here is
  the deal. Instead of just <b>waiting</b> during
  that 1 second recharge time you should try to 
  <b>shoot torps</b> and <b>dodge</b>. 
  This is a very important concept. Let me elaborate
  on it.
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  During dogfights, 
  you have to phaser your opponent, shoot torps 
  and in the mean time dodge <i>his</i> torps.
  The smartest way to do all of this, is to 
  <b>learn the phaser recharge time by heart</b> and
  always be doing your non-phaser stuff (dodging,
  torping) <b>during</b> the recharge time. 
  Then, when the phaser is recharged, you can 
  <b>immediately</b> use your phaser again. 
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  If you do this properly, you will be dealing 
  lots of damage in short periods of time.

  for new players, so I'll just take a short time

  To <b>tractor</b> someone you need to press the
  tractor key (the underscore key <b>_</b> by default) 
  and move your cursor over a ship. You will be 
  tractoring that ship, be it friend or foe. This is an 
  important concept: you can <b>tractor enemies and teammates
  alike</b>. 
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  Let me warn you right away though: 
  teammates generally do not appreciate it when you
  <b>T/P</b> them because they might get pushed into
  torpstreams. Shoving teammates into torpstreams is 
  a definite <i>don't</i> and hence, earns it place
  in section (3.4).
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  Anyway, when you <b>tractor</b> someone, his and your ship
  get <b>closer</b>. When you <b>pressor</b> someone, you
  and his ship <b>move away</b> from eachother. When you tractor
  someone you will move towards that ship <b>roughly 2
  warp speeds higher</b>, and similarly, you will move 
  away 2 warp speeds higher when you pressor.  T/P does use fuel
  but not an awful lot. <b>Top dogfighters</b> are always
  <b>leaning heavily on T/P</b>, just to get that edge on 
  dodging and making torpstreams hit.
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  When you activate your tractor it <b>stays on</b>, until you 
  turn it off. You can do that by pressing the tractor key 
  again, or pressing the separate
  <b>"T/P off"</b> key. It is very common to keep tractor on 
  for a few seconds while you torp your opponent.

  Tractoring and pressoring are both very important mechanics
  during dogfighting. It comes down to a simple
  rule of thumb: you want to be <b>tractoring</b> your 
  opponent <b>when you torp</b>. That way, he'll have to 
  accelerate to move away from you and thus, has
  a harder time to turn out of your torpstream. 
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  The same goes for phasering: you want to be 
  <b>tractoring</b> your opponent <b>when you are phasering</b>
  as well, because that way he will be just that little 
  bit closer, for just that little 
  bit of extra damage.
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  Remember that sometimes it can also
  help to push your opponent into your torpstreams.
  You might have miscalculated a torpstream, 
  which therefore is a bit off: pushing your opponent 
  at that very time might just be enough to make those 
  torps hit.

  T/P is not only a deciding factor in dealing damage,
  but has a major impact on dodging as well, but more on 
  that in the next chapter (Chapter 2, "Avoiding damage").

  >Avoiding damage is an aspect of dogfighting which is 
  just as important as dealing damage. Consider this: if 
  you would never take damage, you'd win all dogfights. 
  So you better read on to find out how you can stay alive
  longer, so you can keep dealing damage, and damage and
  damage...

  >The most important thing to stay alive is to keep
  changing speeds. Why? Because it is harder to aim torps
  at a target which flies at varying speeds. If you
  aim at a target which flies with a <b>constant</b> 
  speed you can smart-guess it's future positions, 
  aim the torps there and make them hit. Aiming torps
  at a target with varying speeds is hard, because you'll
  never know exactly where your target will be. So use this
  to your advantage when you're dogfighting and keep
  changing those speeds!
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10>
  You might ask yourself what this means in practice. Should you
  be pressing all the numberkeys at random to keep 
  changing the speeds? Well, the answer to that question
  is a simple: no. The easiest and the best way to
  keep varying your speeds, is to force yourself to do
  so by changing your keymap. This basically means, 
  mapping one key to a <b>basespeed</b> (let's say: warp 2) 
  and another key to <b>maxwarp</b>. 
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  Now, when you are flying somewhere and you want to fly
  faster you press the maxwarp key, and when you want to
  fly slower you press the basespeed. You'll never need
  the numbers in between because you are either flying 
  somewhere (always at maxwarp), or, slowing down to 
  dogfight, in which case you just press the basespeed key.
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  So far, so good. But how do you use this effectively
  in dogfights? Easy. The best way to use this 
  technique is to press maxwarp like a maniac when you 
  see the first torp of a torpstream flying towards you,
  and click perpendicular to the direction the torpstream
  is flying. (Figure 6 explains this in more detail). This
  way you'll dodge most streams with ease. Just make sure
  you map basespeed and maxwarp to easy to reach keys. And
  oh, remember to press the basespeed key again once you're
  clear from the torps, because otherwise you'll be flying
  at maxwarp speed to some random direction...

  >As soon as you are struck by the beauty of varying
  speeds you'll definitely want to be changing your 
  keymap. This will involve making an important 
  decision: use warp 2 or warp 3 as a basespeed?
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  In practice there is no straight answer to this 
  question. Both basespeeds are being used by a variety 
  of good dogfighters. In practice, the
  main difference between the two are, that
  using warp 2 is easier because you can immediately
  enter orbit on a planet without having to slow down,
  and the advantage of warp 3 is that since you are at
  a higher warp it will be relatively easier to dodge
  incoming torps. Fighting at a higher basespeed also
  means that you drain more fuel though. 
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  For now, stick to warp 2 because being able to orbit 
  planets in a split second is a good thing&#153;. Later
  on, you can always try using warp 3 and see how that 
  feels.

  >Now we arrive at the main thing of avoiding damage:
  dodging! Dodging is a skill which relies on many
  principles, but for now the three most basic ones
  will be explained.
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  First of all, in general, you want to turn away 
  from your opponent when the torps are incoming.
  That way you'll have more time to try to find an
  angle to dodge them. Over time torps always spread
  out so if you move away from them, at some point 
  you might get lucky and slip through them unharmed.
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  Secondly, varying speeds is your friend. As 
  explained in the previous paragraphs you should 
  always use your maxwarp key to accelerate away from 
  torps, so you have more time to dodge. 
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  The third way of dodging involves using tractor
  and pressor beams and is a very important way 
  of dodging. This will be adressed in the next 
  paragraph in more detail.
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  There are more ways of avoiding damage, but these
  will be discussed in the advanced section. For now,
  master these ones and you'll be one step closer to
  becoming a dogfighting-god.

  >Tractoring and Pressoring has been mentioned in the
  dealing damage section, but also earns it place in the
  avoiding damage section. 
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  In general, you can tell the difference between twinks
  and clue in their use of tractors and pressors (T/P). 
  You can safely state, that someone who does not use 
  T/P during dogfights will <b>always</b> lose to someone
  who does. Now, why is T/P so important?
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  Well, using Tractors and Pressors can basically give you
  a momentarily speed-boost of relatively 2 warps. Combined
  with hitting the maxwarp key at the right time and clicking
  the right direction to dodge to, this will get you out of
  hairy situations 99% of the time.
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  When you use T/P to dodge you can either push or pull 
  friend or foe in order to make your ship move in the 
  desired direction. Remember to be wary of T/P'ing teammates 
  though, because while you might skillfully dodge that 
  incoming stream using your buddy as a pressor point, he 
  will likely be pushed into someone elses torps and die. 
  That is a definite <b>don't</b>, but you can read more on 
  that in the next chapter (Chapter 3, "Things not to do").

  >When your ship has two kills, you can refit to a 
  new ship and get <i>plasma</i>. (This can be done by
  refitting to CA, DD or BB, but this manual assumes that
  you'll only fly CA, which is the superior ship to dogfight
  in). Plasma's are 'special' weapons and are very popular under 
  inexperienced players. They are basically big torps which 
  deal 100 damage when hitting. You can only have 1 plasma 
  in the air at a time.
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  OK, the bottomline here. Do not use plasma if you are 
  seriously trying to become a good dogfighter. To put it even 
  more extreme: do not ever use plasma, if you ask me. 
  Why? Because plasma uses a lot of fuel, rarely hits and
  can explode near you when phasered (dealing damage to you
  and your buddies in the process). 
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  To fire a plasma you need 3000 fuel, which is the equivalent 
  of 10 torps, or 4 phasers.   Now, when you either <i>miss</i> 
  your plasma, or your plasma gets <i>phasered</i> (probably 
  hurting you in the process), you basically missed 4 phasers. 
  Missing 4 phasers in a dogfight is a bad thing&#153;, and is a 
  99% guarantee to losing the dogfight. Look at the animation 
  in fig. 7 and see how easy it is to dodge a plasma.
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  The chance that your plasma misses or gets phasered is
  very high. Plasma can be dodged like torps and phasering
  them is just a matter of pointing at them and clicking the
  mousebutton. Consider people who phaser your plasma: you just
  wasted 3000 fuel on it, while they just blow it up with only 700 
  fuel and probably hurt you when doing so. Watch the animation 
  in fig. 8 to see someone get maimed by his own plasma.
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  Plasma deals damage to all ships nearby when it explodes. This means,
  that if someone would phaser your plasma at the very moment you
  fire it, it would explode near you and deal 100 damage to 
  <i>you</i>, or worse, to you <i>and</i> your teammates who might
  happen to be near you at the same time. Your teammates do <b>not</b> 
  appreciate that.
  <BR><BR><img src="dotclear.gif" width=10> 
  To summarize, plasma wastes a lot of fuel, rarely hits, can be
  easily phasered and hence rendered useless, and even worse, can
  explode on top of you or your teammates. Tip of the day: stay away
  from plasma. It is what makes the difference between twinks and
  clue.
