This is clear from the message logs, but to be fair we didn't know
this during the game: it certainly looked like a planned strategy.
Team 80s tried something very similar against us in their game,
although they gave up sooner.

Stockpiling armies for a final push is perfectly reasonable. The basic
complaint is that, when you had 5 planets, you were steadily gaining
armies. This indicates to me that your space control was capable of
defending more than 5 planets, particularly if you were a little more
aggressive. However, you didn't make any effort to push out of core,
even after you clearly had a huge stockpile, even after armies were
beginning to plague off the homeworld (this is with about 30-40
minutes to go). Also, the base never made any move to help the space
control, even though all the oggs during the middle of the game never
even managed to crack the shields. The base hid at Earth in the closing
minutes: what are you saving it for?

It's called "sandbagging": playing to below your potential, surrendering
battles that you have a chance of winning. It's not an optimal strategy,
because you are sacrificing resources that you might be able to hold if
you fought for them. If you had held 6 or 7 planets before making your
final push instead of 5, then you would have had a better chance of
making it to OT, and you had both the armies and the control to try to
fight for that better position. Certainly there is some risk involved
in fighting for more planets, but you have to take some risks if you're
trying to win a tough game.

Not only is it not optimal strategy, but it's also boring for the other
team, because you are basically surrendering all the interesting battles,
and the only ones left are the ones where your team has an enormous
advantage. All the other team can really do is wait until you finally
decide to come back out and fight for the planets that are seriously
under contention. And that's basically what we did, hurl ourselves
at an essentially impenetrable defense while waiting for you to
come back out.

I'm willing to look at it as a major miscalculation: underestimating
what you were able to control, and misestimating what you were going
to do with your 40+ armies (sure, you didn't have kills from 18 to 8
minutes from the end, but with over 40 armies the push should have
started with 30 minutes to go, at least: think of how long it takes
to exhaust initial stockpiles). However, the fact remains that you
underplayed your game, which simultaneously doesn't help you and
makes the game boring for the other team. What can we say?

As to whether other teams will try the same strategy - it doesn't
bother us if teams want to stockpile armies, we can deal with it.
However, if teams are going to stop fighting us for planets, then
what's the point of playing the game in the first place? The object
is to have the most planets, and you get planets by fighting for them.
Beat us up, take our planets, as best you can.

It never occured to me, and noone on my team mentioned it.  It seems
like an obvious thing to do once you say it, but again, it never
occured to us to do that.

I was going to respond to every paragraph in Erik's post, but instead
it boils down to this:  Erik saw that we didn't do some obvious things
that we should have done if we really wanted to win; in truth, it was
just stupid mistakes in tactics by a team that never played this kind
of strategy before.

I agree that we should have done all of the things Erik mentioned
(like taking sooner), except that I wonder about this point:

> your bomber stopping bombing when the other team can't possibly run

What's this about pulling the bomber?  I've heard of the netrek dogma
"Never stop bombing" before, and I tend to agree with it.  What would
be the point in stockpiling armies if you're just going to let the
other team do it?

I had fun.  I'm sure I wouldn't have if I'd been on the other team,
but that's not really my problem.  I know that if we'd played the
standard space control game that I wouldn't have had as much fun, simply
out of frustration at losing at every turn.  This way we at least had
a shot, though we executed the plan less than optimally.

As an aside, these games wouldn't be nearly as painful if they were 60
minutes instead of 90.  Too bad that we didn't try the hour format for
INL this season.

Of course it was for you.  You were fighting the Heroes of Core.  This
game was lots of fun for us (except for our base, who spent lots of
time with nothing to do).

Others stayed after you left, and believe me, they were offended.  The
general gist was that what we did was a dirty, underhanded thing to
do, and that we shouldn't have played at all.  I do recall the word
"assholes" beig used.  I think the post game was just about as
entertaining as the game itself.

OK, I was wrong.  Sorry.

I hope you can see why I thought you were not trying to win.

Usually a team has a bomber to reduce the number of armies
the other team will carry (there are other reasons such as
getting kills by bombing, bombing planets you might take,
reducing planatery fire, etc -- but I don't think these were
pertinent in the last 5 minutes).  Since this is a timed game,
it can become clear that bombing armies near the end of
the game is unlikely to have any impact on the number of
armies the other team will carry, so I think it can make
sense to stop bombing altogether under the right circumstances.

Yup.  I'm sure my trash talking at the end of the game didn't help,
but I hope Tubers and other opponents realize that it's just me having
fun (I usually limit it to a line or two right after the end of the
game).  Tubers played a good game.

If people are bored with teams that try to prevent geno instead of winning
then perhaps you should start supporting a swiss system INL season again.
Sure it's a lot of work but if you want fun games I don't see very many
other choices.  I mean seriously, do you think Smack Pack or Magnum Opus
enjoy playing Tubers and losing every time?  We want to play fun, exciting
competitive games and have a chance to win too.  But as long as there are
random divisions it ain't bloody likely to happen.  As the clue differential
in teams gets worse and worse you'll see poorer teams resort to hoarding
and preventing genocides more and more.

As an aside, planet counts do matter as long as they're used to determine
who makes it to the playoffs and who doesn't.

One thing about Team Tubers puzzles me.  Once they figured out what was
going on, could they have traded bases?  Even if it failed - and El0g is
kinda ok as base :) - they would have had a base again in 30 minutes to 
try again if they were still hugging core then, or to control space if 
Magnum Opus actually did break out.  At worst, I suppose if all of TT's 
armies got bombed, their base died and Magnus Opus still had 40+ armies, 
and the timer was at 45 minutes, would the Tubers have lost much given 
the circumstances?

Not the greatest, but certainly an intentional stack.

Frankly, because they don't have players mewling to the entire known
universe that the team that they crushed didn't play according to their
rigorous specifications.  When another team exhibits the same kind of
bad sportsmanship, I'll probably tell them clue stacks suck too.

A clue stack is a clue stack, regardless of whether they fall apart
in internal bickering or merely play tedious games and then whine about
how dearly they wanted to be challenged.

So Tubers is a cluestack that's also a TEAM.  This somehow excuses your
(and other Tubers') continual ranting and whining about how horrible it
is to have to play in a league which offers you no challenge?  Think
again.  No matter how cohesive your team, it still suffers from the
problem most cluestacks have: a suffusion of egotistical, ill-mannered
twits who couldn't write two sentences in a row even if they were permitted
to plagiarize.

No, clueless.  That wouldn't be a problem, because most teams have the
sole purpose of winning.  The problem is that your team was formed for
the sole purpose of crushing, and WHAT'S WORSE, you mewl like a sick
puppy when you don't get your exact way.

Even though Subby plays netrek like Dustin Hoffman in _The Rain Man_
("oh, sunscreamer's ogging me...that's bad...that's very bad...definitely
bad...now I'm looking at the motd...bad...that's not good..."), I fully
expect that if Golden Bears beats TUS tonight, Subby will not whimper
or make excuses.  And, if GB gets beat, I won't whimper or make excuses.
See, despite the congenital defect that makes him drool and twitch,
Subby has just the slightest modicum of class.

Aw man, you're totally breaking my heart with your brutal attacks on
my team.

GB gets demolished fairly regularly.  That's because we're an actual
bunch of people who play together for fun, rather than yet another tedious
organization of random clue.  And you know what?  Even though we have
Tom on our team, which you'd suspect would be a major problem when we
do lose because he's such a hardass, GB has been around and at least
competitive ever since you were skipping gaily home from kindergarten
in your lederhosen.

No, YOUR WORDS and YOUR ACTIONS and YOUR TEAM are making you out to
be the bullies.  As some little frilly bitch named Subby said, nobody
else in the history of netrek has ever whined so long and so hard
over a game they won.  Or done so much more to repeat that their
hapless victims really had no clue at all what the hell they were
doing.

It wouldn't be so shameful and depressing if you folks weren't so
deadly serious about it.  Heck, I've probably written more slamming
posts than books you've read in your life -- but I don't shoot fish
in a barrel, and I don't slam the helpless unless they beg for it.

So where in there did you conveniently forget that teams like EBM and

that the only possible way for them to make it fun is to innovate?

Right.  You wanted a game which plays to Tuber strengths, and you were
willing to scream about it when you got a game which played to their
weaknesses.  Sound vaguely sad to you, too?

>Not a game

I am, by the way, totally stunned at the idea that Tubers couldn't
successfully take MO down to 1 planet, no matter what MO's strategy.
You were popping many times more armies and had greatly superior
coordination.

I don't often agree with Kevin as much as I do about this. 

>Couldn't you stop your scums from picking up?  

Well, our main scum was Erik, who was carrying armies for maybe 90% of the
ticks of the game.  I think his idea was to draw defenders into chasing him 
into third space.  I don't argue much with his strategic decisions any more.  

A couple of times I said (to team) "look, if we can drop on their planets, we 
can bomb them / kill their base", but I could feel the mood of the team falling
below the point of optimistic play.   

>Couldn't you stop your twinks from getting frustrated?  

2 or 3 of us were trying, but as far as I could tell, the team almost instantly
became discouraged and disorganized.  We couldn't agree on what the hell to
do once we got them to core.  I thought it was fairly clear that we should
try to bomb their stash, but it seemed that some Tubers considered that 
impossible.  I thought we could do it if we killed the base first.  I don't
think we had a single 8-person ogg in the whole game though, even after I 
convinced Dave to refit.  Even with the people who were in the mood to ogg,
we never kept it up for more than 2 or 3 waves in a row, whereas I thought we 
should have just kept ogging for 30 minutes or more until we got it right
or got lucky. 

But, as I said, there was never any consensus on what strategy to use.  Some
thought bombing, some ogging, some scout dropping, some cruiser carrying, some
sneaking, etc.     

One of the great things about Team Tuber has always been that we play well and
cooperatively with very little centralized control.  In close games, it works
well, IMO, but core-breaking games require more explicit coordination between 
larger groups of players.  Andrew, as field-captain, is not used to telling us
what do to all the time.  He usually lets us do our thing, with guidance and 
occasional decision-making, but I think we needed to be ordered around more 
this time :)

That's exactly how I think we should have played.

Probably not.  Their base usually retreated behind the
homeworld whenever there was any serious threat.

Since their base retreated away from serious bombing
efforts, and didn't carry any armies, I am not sure why
MO wasn't better of with their base refitting into another
ship type.  I think their base probably should have picked
some armies off the homeworld (leaving at 25 or so) to
reduce the number of armies lost to plague.

The problems with the swiss are the same as before: (1) it requires
scheduling in serial rather than in parallel, which makes it harder
to schedule games and reduces the total number of games playable, (2)
it requires regular maintaining on the part of an organizer, which
places the season at the mercy of one person already short on
free time.

Generally a swiss is better if you have a lot of time between games,
a round robin is better if you don't. Lately we've been trying to
schedule lots of games, so that teams play most of the other teams
in the league (this season Division 1 was scheduled for 5 games
plus 2 playoff games, 6+2 for Division 2, out of 12 possible
opponents. Having a team drop out of Div. 1 really messed up the
schedule, but then that will maul your staggered swiss too). The
hope is that we can finesse good vs. bad games by just playing
almost all of them.

"Intentional", in the sense that we don't want to waste time playing INL
games with twinks, which basically leaves the set of players such that
you pick any 8 and it qualifies as a "clue stack".  And who are the twinks?
Well, a certain self-proclaimed scout-master, for example... 8)

So we are a clue stack.  So you admit that all of us are good.  Swell.
Thanks for your compliments.  But unfortunately for you, we can't return
the favor.  Like, you've been around forever, and you've never been good.
Sux to be the team that has you on board, it's a priori not a clue stack.

Just because you suck and fail to see how to challenge us doesn't mean
there's no challenge.  VD and TUS are perfect examples.

Hmm, you didn't form our team, did you?  How then could you know what our
teams purpose is?

IMO, all teams are formed for one single reason:  that its players would
like to play with each other for that season.  For me, I don't join INL
to have 'close' games, I join INL to play quality games, where I can expect
myself and my teammates not to make twinkish moves.  So why play with a 
2nd-rate scout bomber when I can play with cress and he wants to play with
me?  (oh and yes, I do think jitesh >> fsg :)

But then, all teams are not created equal.  But this isn't a problem of
us, it's a problem of *you*.  If all you guys didn't suck, then you would
all be "challenges".  It is a shame that there are only enough good players
to make 2 or 3 'clue stacking' teams, but it's good to see some Canadians
and some MIT people catching up.

Then you have a pretty screwed-up notion of "fun".  Your notion of "fun"
is for everyone to play stupidly and try to make the prettiest explosions
with your ships.  Our notion of fun is for everyone to be able to count
on everyone else to be at the right place and do the right thing and be
able to do it (well, most of the time anyway).  Thus our game is comparable
to a fine piece of art work.  And if our opponent plays even better than us
and wins, cool, that's an even finer piece.

Speak for yourself, Preddy :)  

I did make a harsh comment or two, mostly directed towards jeffno, who's
utterly stupid (which would be ok, but-), and yet still acts as though
he knows something about the game.  Well now that I think about it, I'm
probably getting Duck's self-esteem syndrome here, so I apologize to
jeffno now, but I'll still leave the flame here 8-)

This aside, your 'clue stack' is also sad, not appropriate, and ridiculous-
looking.  I for one hope that all teams can be as strong as Tubers and the
old Heroes.  But that doesn't mean I will lower my level down to the average
players.  I will still only play with players I trust, and until everyone
is as good as players on the clue stacked teams, the rest of you will just
have to put up or shut up.

The reason why you can't do this is one of the most fundamental
differences in netrek.  I'll be happy to tell you what it is after the
season's over, but I can give you a hint. Read something that jive wrote.
It's probably in the clue archives.

You are very fortunate that there's no one else in your division. There
have been seasons where the records are the same, and the planet count is
the only difference.  If that were the case, you'd be pissed off for alot

If you think >4 people in the same room is "decent", I wonder if you
really know what it is to play in isolation, as Tubers almost always do. 
I think I played with 2 others one time, and it was cool, but I've never
played an INL game with more than 1 teammate in-room.  Just having 1 was
useful (come back Al!).  

If you guys get groups of 4, 3, or even a few 2's together, you have a 
pretty nice local advantage.  In fact, from what I've heard, having a few 
smaller groups playing together may well be better than having the whole team 
in one place.

Could be because I disabled UDP a coupla days ago for debugging purposes.
I've since determined that UDP isn't the problem and have re-enabled it.
I've finally got at least the crash conditions figured out: 
The server hangs and dumps all clients ONLY when there are 16 players and a

I have not run into that problem yet.  Have you recompile the server with
debugging on and looked at the core to see where it is boming? I might
be able to help you more if you give me some more details.

  Heh, reminds me of the best game my first INL season, it was Wolfpack
vs Footlocker(powerhouse CMU-MIT team).  We were a first season team with
about half first season players.  So we thought we would be lucky to hold
core.  We played really tough defense, we ogged their escorts first and
they could never really get a big escort anywhere near our core planets.
We lost 7-13 or so, but we had a chance towards the end to take it to OT.

  Sure, why not? Just dont buttorp stupidly.  In order to buttorp properly
you have to be in the right place BEFORE the enemy arives.  Figure out which
planet the carrier wants (usually just pick the one you would go for if you
were him, most carriers think alike), then get in front of him and buttorp his
escort while screaming for help.  And DONT watch the carrier, watch where
his escort goes, he will follow them.

Hello,

  I realize that this was probably just a first order quick glance at it,

  You're taking someone away from the front...  Also, if there's just one
kill, a SC might be better.  Depends on the situation.

  A nice seven-man wave comes in.  BOOM!  There goes the army stash.
Well, at least you can have another guy on the front.
  (solution: put in some fuzzy code.  A good base will recognize the ogg
wave setting up/coming and call for help.  You'd need to put such an
algorithm in here.)

   You can't really straight-up assign these roles.  There will be times
when you're going to need the defenders to help ogg and vice versa.
What happens on a double take?  An ogg-take?  THe situation will dictate
how you want to assign the roles, and that is what makes the difference.

>8) A bomber.

  Passive bomb or agressively bomb?  Again, depends on the situation...
Where are their kills?  How does the planet/army situation look?

   A team that cripples/takes out the two (three) oggers will run all over
this team.  THey'll double take or SC drop or just plain play better
because they have the galactic awareness to play the situation.  Things
like kills, army count and placement, useful planets, etc. will all play
a big role.  By simply assigning roles, you're already giving up the game.
  I realize that this was just a quick glance at it.  Don't take it
personally.  I'm merely trying to demonstrate how difficult it'd be to
assign roles effectively.  Sometimes you want to play a good strong
front style and there's another time when you'd want to go and crash-bomb
a planet.  The team's priorities are changed depending on what's going
on in the game.

A SC bomber should still be able to bomb the majority of the
armies not popping on the homeworld -- AS is too slow.

Fine, ignore the home army stash.

If we don't have kills, put up massive defense against this, otherwise
let them take.

>6, 7) Kill oggers, 2 bots that ogg anything that has a kill. Remembers who
>has and has not dropped armies before, and oggs them in preference to

Use SC carriers.  If (6,7) fly sc's, fly by teamates in bigger ships
to give them kills.  Once we have three carrier, just seperate and
let them chase two of them -- as long as robots continue, just
ignore those two pairs of slots.

>8) A bomber.

Use a full time antibomber.

basically the other team can do normal stuff -- ignore the
incredibly passive massively powerful SB (one slot gone).

Don't bother resisting the double escorted carrier (three
more slots, total of four gone).

Let oggers chase forever (two more slots gone, but two
of ours two, now down to a 6-2 game).

Put up a full time antibomber (down to 5-1, with robots
getting a little bombing in).

Rest bomb and scum.  Let bots run out of armies.

>The aim of this team would be to keep the enemy kill flat and army low - in

>over.

Why are the enemies unable to take?  How are you going to
code the oggers in such a way that they don't get isolated with
their target for a long long time?  All the robots I have see have
lost primarily because:

1)  They ogged SC's.  The SC's kept running -- this is now
a long etemp battle, favoring the runner.

2)  They did not have good bombers.

3)  They did not have good antibombers.

4)  They got scummed to death.

Why do people always post strategies that use lots of
oggers and a dedicated taker?  Don't you think the
robots can manage to count how many of their
teamates are carrying, and use ships that can carry?

Why all these oggers?  Teams have won INL championships
with no oggers, and ogging someone is really giving them
the option of making a prolonged non-combat situation.

Why not just put a zone up front, rotate bombers foward
from the front, and rotate ships with kills back to pickup /
take, with the base in the middle of the front?  People
may have a hard time realising their bomber just died,
they are the closest ship, go bomb, and get the nearest
teamate with a lower priority mission to take over your
task, but I think robots could do it.

The reason (for this team) to have the SB guarding the army stash is because
that's the real weak link in the design. Having a central army stash and a
shuttler adding to it simplifies the "taker" code, (only one source for
armies) and makes it easier for the taker escorts to link up with the taker,
if we assume that the taker escorts will always die protecting the take.
(They res at the homeworld, and that's where the army stash is)

However, if a good bomber gets in and thrashes the army stash, then
the robot team can't take. And if a bomber can thrash the stash once, he can
do it many times - so it needs good protection. And it should be capable of
defeating a concentrated attempt by the opposing team to bomb the stash - and
the only ship I could see standing alone in the defence of a single target
would be a SB.

As for an SB on the front, it wouldn't serve a purpose in this design. The
taker has dedicated escorts. There are kill oggers to prevent the enemy from
ever carrying. The army stash is secure. So what if the enemy can fly into
core with impunity? They can't do anything there.

At least, that's the idea. :)

No doubt. Reread the post - I made no claims that "this is the ultimate robot
team" "this robot team would defeat all comers" "This team = bird of prey,
human players = piece of shit" etc. etc. etc. This is merely, were I in the
enviable position of writing a Netrek robot team as a thesis project, where I
would start - maybe.

It depends very heavily on the robots being far superior DFers than the human
players - which is not a given. Perhaps a better attempt would be the mass
onslaught, where every robot charges to the front, gets a kill, and starts
dropping - sort of the Netrek equivalent of a full-court press, requiring the
human team to defend everywhere at once, and depending on the robot team
being able to take faster than the humans can retake. In this model, a
frontline SB becomes a very good idea, 'cause that SB is all the defence you
have.

In any case Tom, I suspect that any robot team is going to have an Achilles
heel somewhere, and that any good human team will be able to find and exploit
it. Humans still win at chess, which is much more rigid in it's rules, so I
suspect it will be a long time before Netrek robots get really good.

It's fun to speculate on though. :)

I picked an AS for this because it could carry more with one kill - but you
have a point. OK, go with an SC shuttler.

The massive defence against the taking team makes sense. How good are the best 'bot

A flaw in my proposed 'bot team is that it assumes that the 'bots are better
DFers than humans, and can thus kill at will. No sooner do you get a kill,
then 'bot ogger from hell races out of nowhere and zaps you. No kills, no
carries.

If this isn't true, then it plain just won't work.

Why not indeed?

Mind you, it's probably easier to program a task-oriented team than a "group
schelduled" team - but "easier to program" != "more effective"

Something to think about.

I think the real advantage of a 100% bot team is that if it was coded
well the team would be completlly clue. If a planet needed defending
it would get defended. If a carier needed a escort the nearest ship
would escort the rest would ignore the request. Perfect organisation
should be the goal of any bot team. Because thats the only real
advantage a Bot team would have over a human team. 

	Also there's the problem. Would the entire team be runing off one
machien? If not they would have to use the messages to comunicate. nd
you would need one robot in controll.(Probily the "A" bot.)

No, I am trying to avoid that.  SC's that are willing to lead their

plan.

If your main plan was "we won't let them get kills", you could
have stated that.  However, I really don't think a SB at the
homeworld and a SC bomber contribute to your plan.  I think
the fact that the other team will probably bring their SB foward
to help fight bots and your SB is at your homeworld will probably
lead to the other team getting kills.  At that point they get to
ignore your SB, and your two designated escorts, then just
match up extra carriers for oggers and SC drop.

Properly matching up oggers against carriers, and picking the
planets to take (and sending the escorts there) sounds
as hard as identifying the undone task, the nearest ship with
lower priority task, and sending it there.  Good torp dodge code
that isn't incredibly CPU expensive might be harder than either
of these.

There is a lot more money in writing good chess programs.

Other than that I would say computers are more competitive
in Netrek than in chess:

Commands are sent via computer network --- interface
is way in the computers favor.

Time to make a decision is shorter.  I think this
favors the computer.

Body of human knowlege (which represents a human
advantage) is smaller in netrek.

Do you think Kasparov would beat DB in a series of 3 min
chess game where moves which was played over a computer
network?

OK, so now we have the SB on the front, making life difficult for the enemy.
This is a good thing. But now the SB has to deal with ogg waves, and more
attackers in general. It becomes much easier for someone (or a group of
someones) to distract it, and then pound on the army stash - so the SB is no
longer doing it's job.

So, is it more important to have the SB on the front, or to have a secure
army stash?

When it's (the SC) escorted by a couple of other CA's. I figure that once the
humans catch on to the central army stash tactic, bombing it flat is going to
be a high priority, so if the SC bomber brings help, the CA can be distracted
or killed while the SC bombs.

I figured the only ship capable of standing off a concerted effort like this
would be an SB.

Because the robots don't care about no-kill ships that aren't threatening the
taker or the army stash.
>

> 
> Why not just space control?

Because control of space doesn't mean anything. Consider this design: I try
and tie every game by not losing any of my planets - no offence, just
defence. So I stick a BB on every planet, and an SB on the homeworld. I'm
safe, right? Wrong. The enemy will just concentrate their forces on one
planet at a time, and no robot BB will withstand 8 attackers.

What counts is taking planets, and to take, you have to get a ship carrying
armies to the target. You can't have space control everywhere at once, and if
you lose control of space your taker is in, then you lose the taker.

OK, so space control massively around a target planet. Fine, except now
there's no defence anywwhere else.

Control in a zone is more attractive, but zone defenders need some way of
calling in help if they get overwhelmed.

I'm only ogging your kill holders. Can robots be counted on to at least
mutual?

That's the real question - how good are robots at fighting?

Well, we do have those "kill oggers" floating around, if the enemy is kill
flat, they should be either controlling space or escorting. That makes 6 on 6
(well, 5.5 on 6, the taker needs a better sense of self-preservation.)

So while my ogger is doggedly chasing that 1 kill SC around in 3rd space, you
get a free run at my taking team. Yeah, I see that.

1) Can your SC get a kill against robot CA's?
2) There'd have to be some sort of threat assessment code in the kill oggers,
ie "Mr 2 kills out in 3rd space is no threat, but Mr 1 kill vectoring on Ori
is"

I'm not particularly committed to the SC bomber, it was more insurance
against a kill slipping through than anything else.

So the enemy SB has to be eliminated right away. Start the game with an ogg
wave?

Just goes to show that it's not a trivial problem, eh?

Man, I wish I had known about this game when I was going to school.

No doubt. :) But a really good Netrek robot team would have all kinds of real
world applications.

I dunno about this, a chess game has very tightly constrained rules, and the
longer the game runs, the closer it becomes to a solveable math problem.
There are a finite number of chess games playable - a very large number of
games, mind you, but a finite number.

Netrek is closer to the "real world" where the rules and number of options
are very much greater. Chess is computable, Netrek is not.

 > That's the real question - how good are robots at fighting?

With the human factor set to 0. I get the following stats (at my own server,
thus no lag)

against a df robot: 0.95
against an ogg: 2.0

And I suck...

The only real advantage of a robot team would be

1) It doesn't loose focus: it dodges the last torps, etc...
2) They ALL listen to the captain

e.g. (roms are a robot team, R0 is captain)

R0->ROM ogg base in 20 seconds (synch on R3)

You can be pretty sure that in 20 seconds all the robots will be in position,
the 20 seconds warning is to make sure that if a robot is low on fuel
it suicides itself or get some more.

another example

R0->ROM R3 pick
R1->ROM Help!
R0->ROM R6 help R1
R3->ROM I have 4 robots (I'm at CYG)
R0->ROM R3 take BET
R0->ROM R4 clear BET
R7->ROM F9++ (near EAR)
R0->ROM R5 escort R3 (synch from LAL)
R0->ROM R2 control POL 
R0->ROM R6 ogg F9
R0->ROM R7 ogg F9 (synch R6)
R0->ROM R3 take EAR     <- The captain noticed that BET wasn't optimal, so...
R0->ROM R4 escort R0    <- clearing BET would be useless...
R0->ROM V formation for escort!   <- Added this one for the tubers! ;)

The planet's names don't make sens but you get the general idea :)

Phil

PS To make sure they don't stupid ogg, create a ogg fuse. After 20 seconds
the ogg command isn't valid and the robot goes back to a default state
of space controlling weak regions ( min(Nfriendly-Nennemy) for each region)

Oh, this is really scary.

The real-world military is developing real-world robots that walk
around (or roll around on treads) and shoot people.  Better aim, and
you don't have to inform the relatives when it gets blown up.

The real-world air force is developing drones that can fly around,
shoot down planes, and drop bombs.  It can maneuver in all sorts of
ways without worring about the pilot blacking out, plus you don't have
to build in a cockpit with all that heavy, expensive equipment.

What's more, the militaries of the world have a lot more money than
the chess players.  Trust me.  They pay my wages.

Be afraid.  Be very afraid.

There are also a finite number of 90 minute + 30 minute OT netrek

Netrek is played over a computer network, and is fairly fast paced.

I think chess programs will be better than humans at chess long
before they are able to solve chess.  I think looking at the total
state space of a game can be misleading.  In most chess positions
someone has more than two of one of (rook, night bishop),
 but these positions are very rare (and the vast majority of these
are probably irrelevant) in strong chess games.

Err, 5 on 6.  Remember you are the one who wants his SB

a human SB still fights better than two robot CA's...

Err, the ship is getting a kill, then running back to the base and
refitting (or the homeworld).

Look, none of them start out going to third space, they move towards useless
areas when chased.  They let the oggers get fairly close (but stay out of
tractor range), the keep giving ground.

If the other team is good, this probably wont work, and will
give them some kills.  Even if it does work, the other team
probably has plenty of kills to go onto the SC drop + bomb
stage.

>I'm only ogging your kill holders. Can robots be counted on to at least
>mutual?

>That's the real question - how good are robots at fighting?

No.   I think you just don't get it.  There is a limit as to what
fighting can do against a good pilot who wants to run, or
a good pilot in a much better fighting ship.

Taker is in SC, and is willing to run all over the place -- third
space, through teamates in larger ships (who also want kills),...
if ogger is going to try to mutual anyway, it is much more
likely that the ogger will give away a kill to another ship than
kill the SC.  It does not have to do with fighting ability of the
pilots.  Small ships (such as the SC) are great at running, but
are weak at fighting.  Actually chasing a SC down who is
happy to run takes a small ship (probably another SC).
This SC is going to have trouble dealing with enemies in
larger ships (such as CA's and BB's) who stand in the
way and want a kill.  Sure a robot SC can dodge torps
terrifically, but it still can be phasered to death.  Sure if
fires fantastically, but it still has limited fuel -- i.e. if it
ends up fighting a larger ship which uses phasers and
dets (and butt-phasers if the SC closes to mutual), there
is a good chance the SC will give up a kill.

	Do you play the same game I do?  I have a hard time seeing how a
scout (even the best) is going to bomb a homeworld stash under a pigbog
CA.  Some of the best scouts in the game tried to bomb KLOC's stash with
me as the enviable (;-)) position of core guard.  I'm a mediocre player
at best.  The problem robot players might have in ASW is when trying
to defend multiple planets against bombing (esp if the other team decides
to add a bomber at certain instances) certainly not when defending a
single planet.

	Get a good borg and have it orbit some planet.  Leave and
come back and take with the kills.  That's how good a planet defender
they are.

	Using a base as a core guard is not only a step backwardss
in netrek strategy, it's also a waste of the strongest offensive ship
in the game.  How many kills per hour do you think a decent INL base gets?
How many kills per hour do you think the rest of the INL team averages?
I'd hazard to say there is not much a difference.  But if you want your
base sitting around the homeworld guarding a worthless stash, fine.
I think I can settle with a 13-7 win because there is no way you're
going to regain your front.

	Of course, what is the point of a core stash at all?  Unless
it's the opening, armies are much more useful if they are dying on
enemy planets then they are plaguing off the homeworld.

	I scum a kill and scout drop your sides.  Since you're obviously
ignoring it, I reduce your planets and take.  If you don't ignore it,
then I get chased into third space and take perhaps your entire robot
team out of the game.  Programming all these contigencies in is not easy.

	This is a far better stragegy than any of your other ones.  I've
never seen a bot bomb well (sorry Joe ;-)) so why try to code one?

	Don't get caught by your own cleverness.

	Ever heard of plink?  It's a great strategy in OT when the other

	Eh?  If each SC carrier takes on two oggers and runs away indefinitely,
then you're running out of players fast.  How many slots does this robot

	Hello?  Everyone AGREES that bots are better dfers.  What we
don't agree with is your confusion that better dogfighting is equiavalent
to better ogging.  This is simply not true.  And for every DEDICATED ogger
your bot team creates, to me that's just making your bot team play a man
down.  Because the first SC taker is going to etemp your ogger in thirdspace
(or oggers)

	Really?  Erik's stategy involves coding only one type of bot.
Your's has a core guard, shuttler, bomber, ogger, and controller/taker.
Hmm....

>Something to think about.

	Sorry about the flame Dennis, but this line is really starting

Uh, what's "flexible" about a human base?  They sit at a single planet,
detting for people docked on them and killing oggers.  Nearly all base

Have you ever tried to ogg a robot starbase?  Nearly indestructible robot
starbases were coded soon after netrek was.  Surviving base oggs is
one of the areas where the robot's tactical advantage becomes HUGE.

I'm not sure that it's been shown not to work.  Losing a space
controller (the base? who is kind of static anyways) to guard armies
isn't so bad when you're trying to retake your own space.  I think we
would have at least had a shot for OT if we had started taking with
about half an hour left.

This is a long problem report. Skip this post if you don't want to hear it.


Hardware: Pentium 75/48 megs RAM
OS: FreeBSD 2.1-Release

Problem: I got the Vanilla 2.7pl2 server source compiled, with RSA support, etc.,
and everything works fine <except>: When there are 16 clients, and at least one
person in the wait queue, when someone leaves the game and the next-in-line in
the queue is about to enter, the daemon dies and all the players get dumped out
of the game. Newstartd then begins accepting connections again immediately and
a new galaxy is begun. Has anyone had this problem in the past? Here's a bit of my
ERRORS file from right before till right after one of these "events":

(This was during a test where I and a friend of mine connected 16+ clients to
the server to determine under what conditions it crashes)

Been a while since I looked at this code, but I'm pretty sure that you do not
get credit for pck in this situation.  Why?  Because that would be a pretty
cheesy way of getting the stat.

I think (but it's been a very long time since I looked at the source)
there's a 7(?) second timeout before a ship with a kill is considered
a possible carrier.

 You obviously dont, or else we all would have a lot more pck than we do. 
I'm not sure, but i thought you had to have 2+ kills to count as a potential
carrier?

You wait to get 2 kills before you carry?

Ok

I'm puzzled (yes... again), what is a crush ?

In fact lets extend the question and define the following winning situations

OT  : close game
9-11: 
8-12: 
7-13: 
6-14: CRUSH  <--- is that it ?
5-15: heroes of CORE
4-16: blowout
3-17: rewlage
2-18:
1-19: 
0-19: paratwinked

Or is it more complicated than that ?
Something like you get crushed if you loose your front line for the whole game.
Thus the ending score means squat.

The TT/MO game, was it a crush ? or more like a heroes of core game ?

 Well a crush is like you know, when you like this girl, see, and well
you're not really sure if she likes you and so you are afraid to say
anything, and...

 Oh, you mean in relation to netrek?

I think it is a soft drink. Or what happens when a beer can meets Karim's

I dont think you can define a crush only in terms of planet count. At least 
not in terms of absolute planet count.. maybe in terms of relative planet 
count.

If by "uninteresting" you mean "not executing a team maneuver", then
you're probably off by about 10-20 seconds (that is,  the maneuver was 
called 10-20 seconds before you noticed it).  Tubers, like most top
clue, are reasonably good at looking uninteresting while preparing
to ogg base.  Of course, other top clue players have gotten good at
smelling base oggs in situations that less experienced players would
not blink twice at.

While base oggs are usually called many seconds in advance, once
in a while the controllers in the vicinity of the enemy base will
be on the same wavelength and execute a snap ogg when the base is
vulnerable.  My most memorable experiences at this were when I was 
playing with Zoo, controlling with Vlad and Wreck.  It's soooo much 
fun.   Very hard to do, though, because you all have to be thinking
the same things.

Well, for someone of comparatively little experience, you seem to 
have summarized it fairly well.  My main comment is that that, in 
practice, your general "space controller" has several things on his
agenda at any given time, and must be constantly making a decision 
about priority.  For example, off the top of my head, an agenda might
consist of:

  bombing some enemy armies that I see
  protecting some friendly armies that I see
  stopping/funnelling an enemy carrier
  escorting a friendly carrier
  waiting to escort our other carrier 
  picking armies
  scumming a kill
  protecting base
  pressuring enemy base back 
  penetrating enemy space to harass enemy ships 

I would consider implementing a robot player as an agenda-based (opportunistic)
agent, perhaps even with a blackboard architecture.  Also note that humans
have to switch attention between the above "action-level" activities and 
"information-level" activies such as:   

  collecting information from the galactic
     number, type, and location of enemy/friendly carriers 
     number, type, and location of enemy/friendly bombers 
     
  analyzing offense/defense  
     do bombers / carriers need more/less help? 
     can I turn the balance on some activity?
          - will I make the difference on saving a planet, taking a planet,
            bombing a planet, saving a base, killing a base, etc.
          - or do I need to call people off of one activity for another?  

Well, hell, this isn't really that easy to organize, and I think you probably
underestimate the coding difficulty.  I certainly agree with you, in principle,
that it's all very possible to automate.  

>...  Flexibility in roles and activities, with the
>decisions practically being 'obvious' situational choices.

It's almost a tautology that flexibility is the hardest thing to code.

If someone out there is constructing a robot team, and would like input from
someone who's spent the last few years playing top netrek and studying AI,
feel free to email me.  I'll help you as much as time allows.

> about priority. 

FWIW, here's my basic space control algorithm (this applies to a
mostly even game):

I divide the front and enemy space into 3 zones: wall, middle, and
open zones. When I start out from homeworld, I pick one zone to go
to. The choice is largely arbitrary; if there is a zone that doesn't
have a friendly CA, I'll probably go there, otherwise I'll head
towards where I expect there to be a battle (the base, or a planet
under contention).

Once in a zone, I try to move forward until I get to about tractor
range of an enemy ship. At that point I stop advancing and focus
on looking at the galactic. I'm blocking the enemy ship from moving
through me into our space, but other than that my focus is finding
something useful to do.

There's three basic things I look for:

1) If my zone has lots of friendly ships, and another one is short,
then I'll switch zones to the undermanned one.

2) I watch the bases, looking for a base with few friendly ships
around. If it's my base, I move towards the base so I can cut off
a potential ogg wave. If it's their base, then I try to disengage
from the enemy ship and get a clear lane to the base; if some of
my teammates do the same, then we'll call a base ogg and have a
good shot at him...if the opening closes up, then I go back to
what I was doing. Of course, this is modified by what else is
going on - a base ogg can't happen if several team members are
busy doing something else.

3) Watch for friendly carriers, enemy carriers, and armies in my
zone (both on the front and forward in my side of enemy core). If
they're my armies I block enemy ships from getting to them, if they
are enemy armies I move to attack them - if odds are even or in my
favor I push forward, if odds are against me I try to delay until
more friendly ships can arrive.

If a carrier is headed towards me, I look for the path he is likely
to take to the target planet. For a friendly carrier, I get between
enemy ships and that path; for enemy carriers, I try to place myself
directly in the path so he has to go through me.

If the carrier is headed to a different zone, I can either move over
to help, or simply stay in my zone and advance - it depends on the
probability of action happening soon in my zone. If I expect action,
I'll just move forward to take the best possible position; if nothing
is likely to happen where I am, then I can either move sideways and
backwards (to defend a planet) or sideways and forward to clear a
planet or cut off the retreat of an enemy carrier. It's very important
not to overrun the battle, because if I'm alone in my zone it's my
responsibility to keep enemy ships in front of me, trapped against
the teeth of our space control.


My fighting algorithm depends on whether there are armies or a planet
at stake - these are the useful battles, to be contrasted with simply
fighting an enemy ship for control of empty space.

If I'm outnumbered: I retreat slowly and fire backwards, keeping the
enemy in front of me and trying to slow down the battle so that help
can arrive, or my team can get something useful done elsewhere. If this
is a useful battle, I'll retreat as far as I can and then hope I rewl:
if there's no planet to be attacked, I'll just keep retreating.

If the numbers are even: if it's not a useful battle, I'll just sit
there, butt-torping the enemy if he wants to push forward. If it's
a useful battle, it depends on who is likely to get reinforcements
first: if we will, I hold even and wait for help; if they expect
reinforcements first, then I'll try to push and hope I rewl and
win before they get reinforcements.

If we outnumber them: if it's a useful battle, then I attack aggresively
to get the clear before they can get help. If it's not a useful battle,
then I probably bail out and move to a different zone since we have a
numerical advantage in a non-useful place.


This is my basic space control algorithm: of course, you have to add
to this a different system of deciding when to stop space controlling
and do something else, like carry or bomb. If we have no kills, then
I try to team up with another CA to get a kill in a 2-1. If I get a
kill, I check who is carrying: if we have less carriers than we want
(depends on your carrying srategy) then I tell my team and go to pick
up armies. Deciding when to bomb is harder: a first guess is if armies
pop in my side of their backfield and our bomber can't get them, then
I'll try to move forward to bomb.

I don't know if this helps robot coders, but it might be just as
useful for would-be INL players.

Tim Wong has just officially quit Team 80's and retired permanently
from netrek.  Since he was our captain and one of our best players,
this is a serious problem.  Needless to say, we are a bit displeased
with him.

Sheldon, another one of our best players, has also retired from netrek.

This leaves our team with a serious problem.  If we expect to play any
more games this season, we need two things:

#1  A manager who can schedule games and practices, recruit players,
    and generally organize things.  This person may also be the coach,
    which we also now need.  Obviously, it would be nice if this
    person or persons was one of our own, and I've already send e-mail
    to our list.  Still, a new person would be better than nothing.

#2  At least two more strong players.  We already have our share of
    novices.  If we want to have a chance of winning anything, we'll
    need some people with at least a year's experience in clue games.
    We also need to make sure enough people show up.

We have played on Tuesday nights and Sunday afternoons.  We could
possibly change this.

If you think you can help with #1 or #2, please write to me, and I'll
see what we can do.

Anyway, it doesn't look promising.  Most of the good players and
captains are already on INL teams.  I am *not* pleased with Tim at the
moment.

Still, some of our good players have expressed a desire to pull the
team together.  We might pull it off.  Therefore, please do not try to
recruit our players to your INL team just yet.  If we decide to
disband, I'll post another notice.

Look, why not just give it a shot with what you have?  Sure, you'll
be crushed, but in a few seasons, those that stick with it will begin
to grasp the concept of rewling.

Tubers journeyed to tomma.dtek.chalmers.se for our INL game vs. ET.
We were worried that the lag would be bad crossing the Atlantic,
but as it turned out the stdv and ploss were better than most of
the home games we've played! Great connections to the server, I
think it's fair to say that lag didn't play a factor in the game
(perhaps much to the despair of ET :)

Tubers took Fed with Rig/Alp agri. ET had an interesting choice
between Rom with Cap/Tau agri and better frontline fuel, or Ori
with El/Pro agri. They took Ori, probably to put the agris in
the backfield and play an army control game.

Opening bombing was well in favor of Tubers, we saved almost
5 planets to 3 for ET. The early going was quite even, but as
the Ori armies ran lower we pushed forward to about 12-8. The
battle was very fierce about this time.

Tubers were ogging the ET base heavily, and about 25 minutes in
finally killed it with a good wave with 14 armies on board. ET
tried many oggs of their own, but the Tuber base defense has
improved a lot and ET couldn't get a good ogg wave through.

Around the middle of the game ET started to get very disorganized.
It appeared they were trying to ASW heavily and gather armies on
Pro for a push while still controlling the front, but Tubers were
coordinating very well and were either able to bomb Pro, or force
through multiple drops. At one point the score had advanced to
15-4-1, but ET quickly fought back to about 13-7. We took El
occasionally but were unable to prevent them retaking, so we
mostly held Arc, Spi, and either Pol or Her. ET eventually killed
our base at about 50 minutes when we left him too open too far up,
but the more forward ship that replaced it was almost as strong.

Probably the key to the game was the base play in the endgame. ET
got their base first, maybe 20 minutes from the end, and again
moved to Pol to help defend it. I'm still not sure what happened,
but apparently he took a lot of damage and wtemp from trying to
clear butt-torpers from Pol, and a well synchronized 4 man ogg
wave just blew him up. I was kind of surprised, but happy.

With just under 10 minutes to go, we got our second base and he
ran agressively to the Ori front. When ET gathered to fight him
back, up at El we had 1 CA with 5 armies, 1 CA escort, and 1 SC
vs 2 ET CAs, and we managed to clear the CAs and take the agri.
This was the death knell: down 14-6 including 1 agri, they
couldn't get enough armies to make OT. The ending had lots of
carriers going all over the place, and we managed to drop armies
in the closing minutes to push the score to 14-5-1, but for most
of the game the score was more like 13-7.

ET played a good game, but seemed like they couldn't put together
the ASW to gather armies with the space control to hold the line.
There seemed to be some disorganization, with CAs milling back and
forth between front and core: I've seen ET play better. For our part,
Tubers played probably our best game of the season, reacting
very well to the holes in the ET defense - we picked them apart.

Thanks to ET for a good game, and a great server. I'm seriously
considering playing some of our home games there :) Considering
the recent state of the US backbone, from the East coast it's
a better connection to Sweden than to places within the US.

Stats follow.

Bah, you said the same thing last year when I used the handle for a game Teddy! 8)
Anyways, it's too late.  I have already used the handle all season long, and I'm
not about to destroy my fragile psyche by changing identies in mid-season. 8)

rebel.  Mayhem.  Drudge Skeleton.  Popcorn.  Tasty Beverage.  Xenocide.
Names few would recognize.  Names that aren't yet etched into the
high clue stone tablets.  Names that some would consider a sign that
Golden Bears is not going to be competitive this year with the large
tedious local cluestacks.

Usual Suspects was handed a big surprise last night in a nailbiter
of a game that saw Golden Bears roar back from down 3 planets to
being up 1 planet in overtime with armies en route for the win.
Unfortunately, Suspects kept their cool and their base, got lucky pops, 
and held on to turn the tide back and win it 11-8-1 with less than 
20 minutes to go.

It was a mild shock entering the game and failing to recognize
over half the team I'm on.  After figuring out that I had indeed
entered on the correct port, I mentioned to Mojo that it seemed
like we were in a rebuilding year -- sunscreamerese for 'I'm getting
out the BB and hanging around in core.'  Indeed, Mojo came up with
the novel plan of putting me on the front and letting one of the
less experienced guys scoutbomb, which lasted about 3 minutes.

Suspects chose Rom, with hyd/cyg agri.  Not being stupid, we chose
green instantly, dooming those two agris and giving us a significant
and near-permanent advantage with Cyg being our front line agri.

Suspects sent only two bombers and protected the rest of their planets
fervently.  We sent a lot of bombers and got roundly crushed as well
as brutally bombed.  Soon enough, Suspects had amassed a forbidding
56 armies on Rom.  We snagged two planets fast, but they had a 30 army
advantage, control of the front line, and strong anti-bombing. 

It only took me dying horribly on the front 4 times for Mojo to 
decide that putting me in a CA was asking a bit much; duck came in,
our scoutbomber sat out, and I got into a scout.

As is the pattern in all games involving MIT, I utterly wasted their
back line agris again and again to the tune of 143 tab.  I paved Hyd
so hard that the locals painted me a parking space.  For most of the 
game, I had air superiority over 2 agris and 3 regular planets --
a control deficit which Suspects had no idea how to handle.  They
dominated the front line, but they were army starved for long 
stretches, a fact which helped us stay in the game during the 
bad times when we were down 3 planets.

Suspects intermittently remembered that they couldn't take planets
without armies and mounted defenses where 2 and 3 ships would fly
at me trying to stop me from bombing.  However, as is also the
pattern in all games involving MIT, their urge to go kill people 
at the front was stronger than their patience, and very often
they would abandon planets they had been guarding for 3-4 minutes
to go kill someone.

Mojo, meanwhile, was on his usual tear, dropping 74 tac with an 85 pad
for 9 planets.

With scant minutes to go in regulation, we surged back to 11-9 with
a deft Lal take.  But then, five red guys converge on Cyg, including
the big red starbase guy!  All the green guys evaporate!  WHO CAN 
SAVE US NOW?  WAIT!  WHAT ARE THOSE WARP 12 QUESTION MARKS?

WILDMAN'S THE PROUD OWNER OF A NEW TATTOO    at the birth of your explosion



So: OT.

They got the first kill in OT, but we managed to ogg it away and get
kills of our own.  We grabbed our planets back and then started
fighting over their front line -- and incredibly, we took the lead.
First at Eri and then at Ind, of all places, we zeroed or took and
controlled.  Suspects were in disarray.  Our carriers sped uncontested
through their space.  Our bombing stepped up...

But, their base walked in and managed to control the front, while
our less experienced base got caught running between the two side
planets and never managed to exert huge control on either.  With
a few lucky pops, they managed to get their base on Cyg with a
carrier, and it was over -- with Duck 1 inch from taking Ind to
prevent the loss.

I was disappointed in the surprising lack of interesting trash talk
in the game.  The most I ever got was when wildman managed to luckily
ASW me in a scout and when wex managed to escape becoming acc by
mutualling with me and a CA who should've detted.  There wasn't much
to the all board, either.  What a letdown.

MVP for them would have to be their SB, who had 163 for-real tac
and who kept control of the front after surviving a really brutal
ogg wave.

Thanks to Suspects for a great, fun game.  Boy, imagine what would've
happened if you all HADN'T been a tedious clue stack, eh?  You
might have had to play as a team to win.

MVP for us is the people on our team I didn't know when I joined.  
Even though they made a few costly mistakes, by and large, they
played with more heart and conviction than anyone I've ever played
with.  We didn't win the game, but we proved again that even a team
of relative unknowns can be very successful against cluestacks
if they've got better team clue, poise and guts.

hmm, i guess GB would be a tedious local cluestack, if berkeley
contained any clue.

what's the line between a local team and a local cluestack?
i guess it just depends if your local players are any good or not.
so you're saying once your local players get good, they need to
split off onto different teams, but until then it's ok to play together?
pretty unreasonable.  but i guess GB will never have to worry about
splitting up...

Has anyone compiled the INL server for HPUX 9? If so, I'd like to know
what you put in the system.mk file and if you had to do other things.
Or are y'all using the standard server dist for INL games nowadays?

Also, in case I can open up a server here in MI, what's there a need for
right now? INL, bronco, other, none?

PS. Robot coders, wanna tune the lowlevel algorithms?
    Let's have a bot DF tournament! Email if interested.

I'm new at this but I really would like to start playing. Does anyone
known of a good, *recent* Netrek client for the Mac? Thanks in advance for
the help.
