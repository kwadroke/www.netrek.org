I worried about CAP-RIG as Tuber armyproducers with Erik between them.

Our main problem IMHO was that with Erik constantly pushing around ARC-POL
our space control was nonexistant. We never build up a real
defence line. That was the reason for our constant base oggs. But i never
managed to get us synced enough...

After we killed Erik we got really into the game for the first time. 
We had control over our core and began retaking our front.

I called at the same time an ET base ogg. KIA was hurt (i had not

We had no real focus. (In the game i thought it was Erik's base and
our problem to hold you KF. Tubers had 2+ takers all the time. And
could carry all the armies from there base or FED frontline planets.
I wished for a 2. TO. Without it i could not refocus the team...)

Eight posts or more is continuity, and I disagree that Polam's arguments

no idea what they were doing and didn't have a great grasp on the
strategy, off a couple of Tubers go mewling and screaming about how

it's a hybrid, at best -- and as I understand it, no three GB

These original goals are laudable.  But looking at the current
roster, I have a hard time believing that those are the actual
guiding principles.  Again, though, it's not so much that your 
team is a large, tedious cluestack, but that your players are
demonstrating by their words and their posts that they joined
in order to get the safe easy crush, and that any other result
demands petulant arrogant bitching.

Calling the losing side of a 14-6 game 'assholes' for playing
netrek their way?  Get fucking serious.  They'd be assholes if
they kicked out the ethernet cable, ping-flooded your machines,
or called in a fire alarm on your building while you carried.
MO didn't do anything that the Buddies team didn't do vs. ET,
and ET *lost*.  Did you see any weepy accusatory posts from
Heiko Wengler on this newsgroup?  No?

You must be joking.  Which exact dozen top clue would rather
be on a stack than playing decent fun competitive games of
netrek?  Names, I want names.

>the half-dozen clue who asked to join us and we turned away, and all

Believe me, elf, I put more blame on Polam's and your team members'
shoulders than yours or your team's.     

>Sucks to be the team everyone

that points to a more distressing and pathetic problem in the
way people want to play INL games.

That continues to be wrong advice.  The problem with MO, as previously
stated, is not that they're not trying as hard as they can, but
that they are totally outclassed by the ponderous masses of clue
who clump together for mutual ego stroking.  No number of extra
Magnum Opuses will cause Tubers to stop being excessive and pointless.

More and more I'm thinking that the problem is that these sorts of
people simply don't want to play competitive games.

The instant answer is Team 80s.  Team 80s has decent players, a
pretty good work ethic (tim notwithstanding), and an expectation
that they're not going to be competitive.  Most of the fun in
top level netrek is taking teams like that to the next level.
I'm surprised you even think it's a close decision, andrew.
Being away from the bagels must've spoiled you.

It would help.  In particular, I don't believe that you actually
needed Erik.  Erik had been on Golden Bears the season before,
so it didn't seem to me like he was ready to sit out and pout
if he didn't get to be on Tubers (the idea still baffles me).
Erik was obviously not part of the fabled Tubers core.  Although
you could say that it's great fun to play with Erik and he
has fun likewise, that's a no-op; everyone has fun with Erik.

I'm sure he did.  But the word they use for women who never

You're missing the metacomplaint.  Obviously they were (although
everyone on Tubers seems to have a different definition of
'clear' than I do).  The issue is now with why Tubers is
a cluestack and why *some* Tubers are arrogant, whiny dicks
when Tubers used to be calm, cool and sportsmanlike.

>That's utterly inconsistent with
>the statement that we were "whining because we didn't get the geno",

no, it's entirely consistent.  Polam's posts have contained multiple
whines about how you were unable to make progress and wheedling demands
that MO play in a certain way (which would happen to play right into
Tubers' strengths).  How do you read that in another way than 
whining because you didn't get the geno?

We were both on Hell's Bagels.  You must have.  Maybe you've forgotten,

and we tried various weird schemes to try to give us a chance.  Sound
familiar yet?

That has little to do with the point, which is that in their avarice,
Tubers sucked all the talent they could get.  In the process, they
became (or picked up) bad sports.  It's a shame.

You're only arguing with about 2 of us, Prasanth and Tom Feng.

If we've convinced you of our original goals, and that our #1 was
achieved with great success, then we're only arguing about the 
5 players on our roster who were not on the team 3 seasons ago
(the bottom 5 on our official roster).  Of these, only Erik is 
gratuitous, IMO.  I guess we accepted him because of his aura.  
I don't particularly mind playing with him, but we could do 
without.  I agree that our latest additions did not adhere as closely
to our guiding priciples as did our original roster, but the  
original roster was fairly remarkable in that regard. 

The fact that we added top players seems to have caused 
resentment in some non-Tubers.  This resentment has been brought out 
and aggravated by the flurry of ill-considered assertions that a 
couple of Tubers made following the MO game.

If you judge our team by the recent posts of a couple of our players, 
you will arrive at the conclusion that our personality has radically 
changed, I guess.  It's not true.  Prasanth is just coming into
the flower of his mouth, or some such metaphor.  Remember, he's 
the youngest member of our team, by a fair bit, I think, and co-
captain of an undefeated team.

I don't want to publically disagree with strong statements made
by another Tuber, but since I already have in another post (one
that concentrated on our strategic decisions during the game), I'll 
say again that I agree with you here. 

...

Well, this isn't a very clear sentence, but if you're saying that
you don't assume Tubers all share the views of our loudest member,
then thanks.

Could you please explain the manner in which Tubers are excessive and 
pontless?  It seems to me from looking at our roster that we are less 
excessive and pointless than many other teams that the INL has seen, 
and we are not a runaway leader this season, either.  

And as for "parity", does that mean having all INL games be close?
Just to clarify, is that your goal? 

...
>More and more I'm thinking that the problem is that these sorts of

Erik effectively stated that he joined our team to make us more 
competitive, if you remember.  Now, I think he was mistaken in thinking
that we needed him, but I don't think he was being disingenuous.   

...
>>> Please.  You added the best base in the game.

Andrew, we could have just not invited him.

Actually, he did say he had a lot of fun with us after his trial
scrimmage. And that game was a heck of a lot of fun.  

>I'm sure he did.  But the word they use for women who never
>say no applies to your team nevertheless.

You're just saying that because we slept with the prima-donna starbase
player of the league.  You would have slept with him too.   

>  The issue is now with why Tubers is

That's two issues.  The first seems to say that our roster is immorally
talented.  The second is merely choosing the words of Prasanth on which
to form your opinion of us instead of the less provocative words of 
Andrew and me.  I don't think the traditional Tuber nature is  
gone just yet.  Most of us are the same players we were last year.    

...

If we sold our character in accepting free-floating top clue, as you
portray, we did so in innocence.  It pains me to see Team Tuber 
serve as the hapless subject of your latest diatribe, even if you are, 
as usual, some fraction tounge-in-cheek.

As one of the new Tuber additions, I feel particularly bad about all
this change of "character" talk regarding the Tubers.  After the Babes
won the belt last season, I finally got the monkey off my back after
being on a number of contending but non-champion teams.  My goal this
season was to have fun, and if I hadn't been offered Tubers, I'd
probably have went to MO or some other "non-cluestack" team.  But
there are a number of players on Tubers that I've played against for
eons but never had the chance to play with.  I don't consider myself
as top clue but I'd like to get there, and playing with new people
also gives me a chance to check out other strategies and methods of
playing.  Whatever my reasons, joining Tubers was far from a "gee
I really want another belt" decision.  I've got a belt.  I just want
to play fun games with players I respect.

Looking at the other players which joined Tubers, I can't see why
anyone would say they have bad attitudes.  I accepted the Tuber offer
before erik joined up, and I am really glad he did join Tubers
because he is someone I can learn from and enjoy playing with.  
I mistakenly thought my buddy Wreck would join up as well because
I thought we all (erik, leonard, and I) had a great time at a
Tuber recruiting scrimmage.

Polam might have got a little hot but frankly I can understand (if
not agree) with getting pissed at relatively inactive INL games.
Big freaking deal.  Now all the netrek sages are jumping over the
Tubers as the bad sports of netrek with labels like tedious clue-
stack and bitchers/whiners.  Try not to be hypocritical.  I seem
to recall even felix joining some ancient cluestack with more
explicit notions of crushing opponents.  And I'm sure the folks
at TUS *never* try to start their best when playing tough 
opponents.  Time to shut up and play instead of stroking yourselves
with in-depth analyses of a team your not a part of.
