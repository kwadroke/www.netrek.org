Continual ranting? Methinks you overexaggerate. One game, one sequence
of posts, which largely contained reasonable arguments that MO,
probably not intentionally, underplayed their position. The situation
would have been no different if it had been the better team that
underplayed their ability. In fact, the main reason I brought up
the issue was to get people thinking about what would happen if
teams deliberately played an extremely defensive game. I do think
that that would make netrek games less interesting, and as a member
of the INL council that's a distinct concern for me.

Well, I'm not egotistical enough to get in a flamewar with you over
this, does that count for something? Whoops, that's only one sentence,
I'll have to use this one to pad it out.

Was on the middle two, and GB is still mostly a local team. In fact,
before forming Monster Squad I was on 6 teams over 7 INL seasons, so
I have a good idea of how these at-large teams tend to work. Monster
Maggots/Tubers has lasted longer than all the at-large teams. And, of
course, it would be extremely unlikely if all the Tubers joined for
the same reason, or had the same goals.

Seeing as I'm the captain, I think I have a pretty good idea of why
the team was formed. We were looking for two things: (1) an at-large
team without personality conflicts that would thus be able to stick
together over several seasons, and (2) a group of people flexible
enough to try new INL strategies. #1 has certainly worked out for
us, #2 varies depending on how well we are playing.

The principle reason that Tubers has so many good players is that
almost a dozen top clue would rather sit out of the INL season
than join a team other than Tubers. This is hardly my problem -
if you're going to harass Tubers as a clue-stack, then also harass
the half-dozen clue who asked to join us and we turned away, and all
the clue that would join if we asked. Sucks to be the team everyone
wants to be on.

I've said it several times: if you want parity, then form more teams.
Babes broke up, and what happened to their players?  Half filled in
extra slots on Tubers and VD, and the other half are sitting out
the season. Go make a team these people want to join, and you won't
have this problem. Of course, the average INL team goes poof after 1-2
seasons, so it's obviously not that easy. Which team would you rather
be on right now, Tubers or Team 80s? You can't tell me no one considered
that possibility at the beginning of the season.

Counterpoint: Tubers lost to Babes last season in a playoff game. I
don't recall any whimpering or excuses then. In fact, I seem to
recall some congratulations on a game well played.

> Please.  You added the best base in the game.

Erik chose to join us rather than many other teams that would have
taken him. What, am I supposed to club good players top make them
go away? He just might have joined because we were more fun to play
with. Or not, I don't claim to speak for other people.

You're completely reworking the argument into what you want reality
to be. The entire complaint was that MO was holding a very defensive
position long after it was clear that being more agressive would
allow them to hold more planets. That's utterly inconsistent with
the statement that we were "whining because we didn't get the geno",
but conveniently ignoring that helps support your view of Tubers as
an intentional cluestack.

Hmm, in 7 seasons I never really noticed that. Granted, getting genocided
in 25 minutes by Arrogant Assholes wasn't much of a learning experience
(well, we learned that if you can't shoot, you lose). Other than that,
we usually had an interesting and fun time clawing and scratching like
wolverines trying to hold as many planets as we could. The people from
those teams that didn't retire are pretty good players nowadays (of course,
it's not too surprising that most did retire, since the netrek player
turnover rate is pretty high).

As it turns out, MO really isn't as bad as most people think. They
can phaserlock well, which is key to a good defense; our genocide of
SP was in large part because they had a hard time locking our bombers/
carriers. The main reason we were able to drop on MO core is that they
were completely dedicated to defending the base/stockpile; again none
of our base oggs ever managed to *scratch his hull*. That's good defense.
When they had 5 planets, they were steadily gaining armies.

That's really the whole point, that the game is decided on the field,
not by what people think the score will be. If GB had thought that
they couldn't defeat RA, they wouldn't have gone out and done it.

GB is mostly a local team.  However, our machine availability is so bad,
that we almost never have the luxury of using a lab for games, and end up
playing in separate rooms, or in peoples' offices if that's an option.  
The last game where we had a decent number (>4) of people in one room was
last SINL season.  I don't know what point this proves, but for all intents
and purposes, we might as well be an a spread-out team.

Eh, I think you need to learn some basic logic Doug.  MO hardly gave us
a challenge.  I concede that they made the game boring, but I GUARANTEE
we were not running around in fear of losing to them.  I agree that
VD, TUS, and Tubers are far and away the best teams in the INL.  That's all

what we consider a challenge.  Although we know we will probably beat most
teams, we want them to atleast try and bring the fight with us.  I 
understand that's a hard thing to do and I respect that.  But, I don't think
what MO did in that game represented any sort of willingness to even 
engage us.  That made the game "boring", hardly a challenge.

NOT!  You can in no way shape or form compare this team to either of the
above two teams.  Those teams were formed almost solely on the basis of
winning the champsionship.  When me, Al, and Andy decided to form this
team, we gathered people not only to be competitive but also to have fun.
Hence, there is no more SP or Heroes, but this team is running strong and I
see no signs that we will disband in their near future.  In addition, where
Heroes didnt have success, Tubers/Maggots have won an INL championship
already, and we have been among the top teams since we were formed (vying
seriously for a title in each season).  At the same time, you don't see us
crumble when we dont win.  Thats the difference between a stack and a team.
We have gutted out the bad, the loses, without resorting to finger pointing
and name calling (IMO, the sole reason why MOST pure clue stacks dont work).

We don't need your pity.  We don't need your approval.  We brought MO's
faults out to try to bring out discussion about why stockpiling LIKE THEY
DID (ie, not using is early enough or being semi-aggressive) was
ineffective.

Tuber's Bus: The Madden Cruiser
TUS' Bus: Greyhound Tour Bus

Bring it on.  Like I said, I can't wait till we play it out on the
field.  Then talk your shit all you want.  I didn't want to sound so
arrogant, but it seems to me that TUS (in particular Doug) has an
inferiority complex.

I'm personally responsible for the total destruction of two INL teams,
including one you were on.  I was scout bombing before people knew it was
a good idea.  I've advanced the state of the art, taught innumerable
people how to play, and been on some of the only real at large teams,
including the first ever, to make it into the playoffs.  

And let's see, by comparison, you're just another CA, and your
biggest "achievement" has been being a prick about client authentication.

No, I don't worry about GB presenting a challenge.  What bothers
me is that not only are you (now obviously and openly) admitting
to trying to stack the deck, but your team bitches and moans and
whines like spoiled ten year old girls when something goes wrong.

I admit I'd have understood this quite a lot sooner if I had
figured out that there were people from RA on Tubers.  It
all gets crystal clear now.

I was kicking ass while you were trying to figure out how to get

I so totally dominated our last game against you that your team
not only lost, but disbanded weeping and blaming?  Let it go, man.

I'm personally responsible for the total destruction of two INL teams,
including one you were on.  I was scout bombing before people knew it was
a good idea.  I've advanced the state of the art, taught innumerable
people how to play, and been on some of the only real at large teams,
including the first ever, to make it into the playoffs.  

And let's see, by comparison, you're just another CA, and your
biggest "achievement" has been being a prick about client authentication.

Man, you Tubers are coming up with some super-clever heavy insulting shit!

No, I don't worry about GB presenting a challenge.  What bothers
me is that not only are you (now obviously and openly) admitting
to trying to stack the deck, but your team bitches and moans and
whines like spoiled ten year old girls when something goes wrong.

I admit I'd have understood this quite a lot sooner if I had
figured out that there were people from RA on Tubers.  It
all gets crystal clear now.

so you want it to be 'quality', but you really don't want it to
be 'close'.  My.  How thrilling netrek has become.  You know,
you could just stay home and masturbate all day.

Indeed. Then getting past 14-6 when the other team has 40 armies on earth
and are just clumped around in the core isn't a challenge for you?  I
guess it would be for me, and based on the other responses I've read
(Kevin's in particular) it'd be a challenge for them to.

I think we can agree that we disagree on this.

You don't need to prove to me that you aren't a clue stack. That wasn't
the point I was making.

(BTW, when did Tubers win the championship?  My memory seems to go back to
Babes, KLOC before that. Maggots won in the summer, I think, but summers
are different anyway)

Hmm, my list would probably be:

1) Bert
2) Dazzler (GB)
3) Helix
4) cress

This is cuz they could fight you for the bomb, as well as bomb

then would be guys like sunscreamer, joe beck, and some other guys...

This is back in the days when I used to do anti-scout primarily, which was

This is an interesting comeback, especially since I wasn't talking shit, I
was stating fact. Tom said that MIT was "catching up." I am merely point
out to Tom that teams that MIT has been on have done pretty damn good
(read: win) against teams that he's been on, and thus the catching up
reference was a bit offensive.

And as far as me respecting the people on my team, they can vouch for me
that I do.  I am glad that you respect them as well.

I see.  Please show me the INL game that we guys got thumped in.  Try and
avoid the 2 times we forfeited since 1992.

With all the love you guys have for each other, you might get to heaven

This has nothing to do with anything I said, but anyway:  I'm not really
interested in what you need.  I'm sure you go home every night to someone
(female, male, pet) that is interested in your needs.  All I am saying is
that if someone does a strategy that you don't like, then it's your
problem, not theirs.  Capiche?

That has less to do with your not giving up than your playing
opponents which weren't even close to clue par.

Give me 6 MO players and the MO base on homeworld, pick *any* 8 clue
in the INL, and I bet you'll be unable to kill that base.  The only
way 8 oggers can kill a base at homeworld surrounded by 7 escort is
if (1) the escort and base are non-clue, or (2) the base is already
heavily damaged.  The way to screw up any attempts at ogging a base
at homeworld is simply dumb anti-ogging which lets you res at the
homeworld.  And MO was doing some dumb ogging for much of the game.
With just 2 anti-oggers, you can take out by mutual or crippling 2-4
oggers ... which leaves 4-6 oggers vs 5 escort + 1 fresh base.
No way man.  No way.  And if you think you can do it, we can arrange
a "put up or shut up" test.  Six captains vs a base = dead base.
Eight clue vs 7 clue escort + fresh base @ homeworld = live base.

The point I was making is that we were never in danger of losing.  The
challenge you think you can overcome is not as easy as you think.  If you
think you are so much more clued or better than Maggots/Tubers, then try
playing MO when they are all in core with the base on EAR.  I don't care who 
you are, you arent going to kill him.  The general trend in INL has been a
gradual increase in clue level.  Maybe you guys underestimate MO.  They
are not a pick-up team, and they certainly have enough skill to hold 5 planets
and save their base.

>Sounds like you guys don't have Hector or Von (who's a good guy, really).
>That's an accomplishment in itself.

Umm, making no direct reference to either of the above, we selected people
to join the Monster Squad/Maggots/Tubers roster on the basis of their
personality more so than "pure clue".  Granted, we did ask high clue, but
only high clue that we knew were cool to play with.

Tubers == Maggots, the 2nd version (duh!).  In any case, that team which
had Spaceace, Akira, and Wreck in addition to our regulars would have won
regardless.

When you start calling Tom a cocksucker, you don't expect me to get offended?
If that's not trash talking then what is?  I just tried to defend my 
teammate.  This is in no way saying I don't respect and even like most of 
the people from MIT (and a few of them even respect me).

How about when CMU genosided you?  Can't get more embarrassed than that.
Especially for the high clue that MIT has, right?
Note, I said CMU carried a lot of the baggage on FL...

Duh, you don't seem to understand.  Neither of the two versions of Heroes
won shit.  We have.  Case closed.  They might have looked better "on paper",
but we play better as a team now.  (It is interesting to note that a huge
portion of the Heroes roster reassembled on Maggots/Tubers.)

OK. When I said that sentence I was trash talking, but it was at the end
of the post, and it's the most recognizable line in The Usual Suspects
(it's the time when the five guys are in the police lineup, and they're
reading from that sheet of paper)  Of course, you'd pick that irrelevant
sentence out and not the sentences which addressed major points.

You really should go see the film. I mean, how can you expect to win if
you don't see the movie? You won't understand a single thing that's
happening to you.... :-)

When CMU genocided us.... Let me think. Yeah. Yeah, this thread is easily
the stupidest one I've ever participated in, and there used to be some
dumb ones in rec.games.empire....

Please post the stats of the INL game that CMU genocided MIT.  If you
can't do that, then please post the names of the two teams involved.  If
you can't do that, then please post the names of the players in this game
you're refering to.

If you can't do that, as they say here in Boston, "Hello in there Cliff.
Tell me, is the sky blue in your world?"

(BTW, If you think that 4 CMU players could single-handledly beat the
Heroes, then you must think there's no hope for any of us, since VD has
Akira, Spaceace, ryche and ensign. You don't even realize it, but by
saying that, you're selling some of your own teammates short (including
the one you started this post trying to protect).  You're definitely
selling alot of my teamates short. But don't worry, they'll read this, and
remember it. You've just given me locker room material. And don't try and
salsa your way out of this. It's in plain English..)

In that endeavor, I wish you good luck.  To let you in on a little secret,
it is gonna be very difficult for anyone to beat VD, given that they've
lost one game so far... It's kinda like what's happening with Kentucky in
the big dance (after losing the SEC to Ms State).

Heh. The poor persecuted sole.  This the same man that was talking trash
from the beginning of the season. Don't ask me to point out examples, I'll
nail you to the fucking wall.. (and no, I didn't mispell anything in that
sentence). If you couldn't take it, you should have just kept your mouth
closed from the beginning.  Now that I've called you out, you're trying to
turn it like I'm antagonizing you?  You're making me misty.

Well, I'm glad to see this thread dying out finally...the arguements
were funny...one person's opinion vs another with no way to prove
anything.

Sure, Tubers is a cluestack...so is VD and US.  And there is league
parity in the same sense that EVERY PROFESSIONAL SPORT HAS PARITY.

You have your top tier teams (VD, Tubers, US)
your middle teams/contenders (GB, LaggU, T*, ET, Team 80s)
and your bottom teams (MO, HNIC, etc)

	Name one of the major professional sports that doesn't have this same
division? 
	NFL?  Hardly..Dallas, San Fran.
	NHL? Look at Detroit and Pgh for starters
	NBA?  Chicago...all I gotta say is Chicago
	Baseball?  Closest..but still have some teams that are 0-season vs
		the better teams

	So don't dream of 'league parity'..it will never happen in that all
teams are roughly equal.  The best you can get is down to 2
brackets...really good teams and contenders.  

	Which brings me to my second point....all this trash talking about what
did what to who is meaningless.  It's going to come down to two games. 
TWO.  As in the you win one and lose one and you are a loser.  It's a
four member dance and only one gets to fuck the babe at the end.  I can
guarentee that three of the dancers are going to be Tubers, US and VD. 
Yeah, that means I'm predicting a victory over GBs.  And to make it to
the finals, Tubers are going to have to go through us.  Think you can
make it 3-0 against us this season?  When we finally get Rob to our
game?  We're x-0 when he shows....  I predict it will be a single
division final this year....think about it and you'll know what I mean.

While we are talking about "fun" and "cluestacks", I'd like to say that
one of the scrimmages Tubers had vs VD was simply awesome.  It was the
best most clue-filled game I have probably played ... Tubers won in OT.
I remember looking around and thinking I was probably one of the worst
players out of all 16 :)

If Tubers werent as "cluestacked" as VD, we'd never have those kind
of games where it all hinges on a few good plays at the end.

Yeah, I'm with vlad.  I don't give a damn who won.  There were both 
intense fucking games.  If everytime I sat down to play netrek, and
had games like VD vs tubes, netrek would be 10 times better.

We think about an homeserver which has better lag for us than the

I worried about CAP-RIG as Tuber armyproducers with Erik between them.
(Plus TAU sucked as an AGRI)

I don't understand why we failed so badly  in bombing. Probably wrong bombing

After 5 mins i thought this could be geno time for us. 
Tubers were so hard pushing....
But we countered (with a bit of luck and good defence play.)

Our base denfence sucked. (And KIA was local.. or i thought so..)

Our main problem IMHO was that with Erik constantly pushing around ARC-POL
our space control was nonexistant. We never build up a real
defence line. That was the reason for our constant base oggs. But i never
managed to get us synced enough...

After we killed Erik we got really into the game for the first time. 
We had control over our core and began retaking our front.

(I think our disorganization and Erik in the base gave you the win.)

I called at the same time an ET base ogg. KIA was hurt (i had not
realized that.) and after i told my team todo what i say they let
KIA alone and your wave succeded and ours not. That was the end...

We had no real focus. (In the game i thought it was Erik's base and
our problem to hold you KF. Tubers had 2+ takers all the time. And
could carry all the armies from there base or FED frontline planets.
I wished for a 2. TO. Without it i could not refocus the team...)

Congrats to Tubers for a game well played!

PS: But we will meet again in the finals!
    This game was a good wakeup call for us. We can play much better.
    Sad that we could not pull it off this time....
