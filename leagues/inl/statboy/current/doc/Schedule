This season we have 13 teams, and again we have a lot of parity, with
at least 6 teams having a shot at the title.  Once again we will be
splitting the teams into two divisions and running a round robin in
each division (each team plays every other team).

Since the number of teams is odd, Division 2 will have one more game to play
than Division 1; if a team drops out early, we may do some reshuffling.
Division 2, especially, will have a lot of regular-season games; GET
SCHEDULED EARLY so we don't have to worry about forfeits and unplayed games.

There will be a 4-team playoff between the two top teams from each division.
The format and the manner of selection will be the same as in previous
seasons.

The teams were divided randomly, using a perl script I wrote specifically
for this task.  The perl script, and a transcript of my session, are
available upon request.  If you are not satisfied with a transcript of
my session as verification, I suggest you seek professional help.
