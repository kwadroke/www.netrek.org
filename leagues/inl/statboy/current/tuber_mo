This was a home game for Magnum Opus.  Tubers chose Rom with agris Tau
(back core) and Sirius (open side, non-front).  MO chose Fed with
agris Can (front line) and Alp (forward core).

Opening bomb ended up being about even, though Tubers did all their
bombing in the first wave, while MO took a little longer.  Tubers and
MO both saved 2 planets worth, with the Tuber stash on Ind (front
line) and the MO stash on Ear.

Things went down hill very fast for MO.  We had a hard time focusing
on their carriers, while ours were stuck in core.  Within 10 minutes
we were down to core (yes, 10 minutes).  It soon became obvious that
any planet we tried to take was quickly and easily taken back.  So we
stopped trying.  We defended our core and stockpiled on ear, with our
base protecting it.  Near the end, the stockpile was around 40+ armies
at Ear, with about 15-20 on the base.  The plan was to wait to the
last 10 minutes and then retake.

Our core defense from then on was mostly solid, with the occasional
Tuber sneaking through the defense to take a planet, which was then
quickly retaken.  When the Tuber base (Ahn) would open up, we would
ogg, but within seconds his fellow Tubers would be there to save his
ass.  They eventually pulled the base to help ogg our base (Faust) and
bomb Ear.  That strategy was unsuccessful.  Wave after wave was
smashed at Ear.

The Tubers were getting really frustrated.  With about 20 minutes
left, they switched strategies.  They put Erik in the base, started
stockpiling armies, and huddled in their space around the base.  Not
only that, they kept us kill flat (and I mean FLAT).  Finally, with
around 8 minutes left, we managed to trap R4 away from his buddies.  I
got the kill and raced back towards Ear, but was out of fuel and
killed by R7, who managed to mutual with another Fed after killing me.
But Tubers were now disorganized, and F1 and Fa each scummed a kill.

We resumed taking planets.  So did Tubers.  Erik pushed the base to
our core.  They managed to doosh some of our carriers taking back our
planets.  Time ran out on us, and the game ended 14-6.

Post game: whine, bitch, moaning, insults by the Tubers.  Some of the
things said (these aren't exact quotes; you can read those after the
next game held at dias):

"Thanks for wasting our time"
"Weenies"
"You played to lose"
"Score doesn't count"
"What a boring game"
"Why did you bother playing?"
etc.

I think what really set them off was our (my?) gloating at the score,
and cries of NO GENO.  Maybe next time I'll just rave about how great
the other team was and say how bad we suck.  Nah, that's no fun.

What gets me is how the Tubers thought we were wrong for playing the
strategy we did.  For one: We did not set out at the outset to do
this, it just sort of happened.  Two: What's wrong with the strategy
we played?  Saying we played to lose is ridiculous.  We played the
only strategy we thought that would give us a chance to win.

So you say it was boring.  Well, I certainly had fun.  Should I play
to appease the other team?  Would it be that much less boring fighting
a team with 2 planets?  Do you deny stockpiling armies and then
retaking many planets at once as a valid strategy?  I do understand
that the game is less interesting when we play like we did, but
fighting a team like Team Tuber brings out play like this.  We didn't
do it against T*, and I don't plan to against any of the other teams,
but I also won't rule it out.

I will say that Markiel has the most class out of any guy on that
team.  Erik was at least willing to discuss things rationally.  Dan is
just an all around cool guy, and didn't seem upset by the whole thing.
As for the rest, and especially Rh (zpzhang@tea.Princeton), spamming
insults doesn't make an argument.

It is?

With 15 minutes left, your team has no kills, the other team is
not going near your pile of armies on your homeworld.  If you
were really playing to win (or draw), wouldn't you move the
pile of armies from the homeworld to alp (closer to the
planets you want to take, and an agri to build armies faster)?

With 3 minutes left, does it really makes sense for your
healthy base to retreat behind your core planet when the
enemy base is getting in the way of your take attempts, (that
you need to have any chance of reaching OT) rather than
trying to fight the enemy base?

>  We played the only strategy we thought that would give us
>a chance to win.

Stockpiling made sense.  Never moving the armies to alp,
not having your base try and assist your push, not even trying
a take when you have 42 armies on the homeworld and plagues
are destroying armies twice as fast as they are popping does
not.

No.  I deny that refusing to move the armies forward with
10 minutes left is an attempt to win.

To me it seemed that your team was not playing to win.  Perhaps
it was some players not trying to win, and others not knowing
how to.  Also 10 minutes seems really strange given how many
armies your team had -- I don't see much chance of you running
out if you had started with 15 minutes left.  Are you trying to
save armies in case you reach OT and get a kill within the first
couple minutes of OT?

I never stated stockpiling didn't make sense.  Rather that
your team did not make very obvious moves towards trying
to win or reach ot.  I do think it was a pretty lame game, and
that the other clue game was probably a lot better.  Huddling
in your core was something that "just happened".  Moving
the armies forward to your core agri late in the game, base
actually pressing forward to your core planets at the end
of the game, your bomber stopping bombing when the
other team can't possibly run out of armies,... these were
things that did not happen -- it certainly looked like your
team was not trying to win, but just sit around and scum stats.

>FED    Vega                 1 CORE REPAIR
>FED    Alpha Centauri       6 FUEL AGRI

Isn't it VERY obvious your team would have started using
some armies much earlier if it were trying to win?  How
long do you think those spare 36 armies would have
taken to use if your takers are showing a reasonable
amount of discretion?  This is what is left after your team
started throwing armies around with precious little
discretion---  if your team had started taking with 30 minutes
left (but bailed from very poor take situations), I doubt they
would have run out of armies.  This is what lead me to
believe your team was not trying to win.  Not the passive
play during the first 50-60 minutes, the continuing passive
play for the duration of the game -- like most of your
team was just happy to lose.

I don't see why saying your team played to lose is ridiculous.
If the team was playing to win, surely someone would have
thought of moving the armies from ear to alp, or having
your base move towards a planet to take near the end
of the game, or using some of the armies when it became
clear that your team was probably never going to run out.
Since none of these did happen,  is it more ridiculous to
say that your team was playing to lose, or think your
team was playing to win but was unable to attempt any
of these things?

I said then, and I stand by my statement, that it was a boring game.
And that was my only statement before leaving to do other stuff.
I didn't say I was offended by your plan.  I knew that I would rack
up quite a bit of eao had you really tried to take outside your 
core even in the last 10 minutes ... and I really thought we could
hold you kill-less up until the end.

But Tubers vs MO was essentially a variant of a BUDDY game with MO
huddling in core.  You guys should have used tech more and exclaimed
"SMACK", "NICE SHOT BUDDY!", "SAVING LITTLE KIDS BUDDIES!"

The game was very boring since it was essentially a standoff at 15-5
and we were all waiting around for the 10 min mark.  That kind of
passive play is, by any name, boring.  It's not whining.  It's not
bitching.  It's simply a description of the game, just like I can
say Tubers vs SP today was fun because I got to pull off a successful
WRECK MANEUVER.  So take your 6-14 game and file it in the weird
games of the INL ... glad you enjoyed it ... but then again, I usually
enjoyed being a BUDDY even though I knew the enemy was <what word am
I looking for> ... bored.

Team Tuber went to dias.umiacs.umd.edu for our INL game vs. Magnum Opus.
Lag was OK to mediocre, with perhaps a slight advantage to MO. Tubers
were away and took Rom with Tau/Sir agri, MO took Fed with Can/Alp agri.

Opening bombing was in favor of Tubers, who saved 4 planets to MO's 3.
Tubers immediately started eating up the MO front line (MO never dropped
armies in Rom space).

After some initial trading of planets, MO appeared to take the, er,
interesting strategy of hoarding their armies on Earth and defending
their core until they could ogg our base (which never happened). After
securing their outside 5 planets, we had an extremely difficult time
making further progress. After trading in the base for another ogger
we tried ogg waves at the base (at Earth) and bombing waves at the
Earth stockpile, but the Fed defense was solid and we were never really
close. We could occasionally drop armies on the core, but of course they
immediately retook the planets. This went on for a long time, with
Tubers not really sure how to crack the defense.

With about 40 minutes to go, and the Fed stockpile still at 40 armies
or more, it was clear we weren't going to make much further progress,
so we decided to bring the base back and load him up with armies, so
we could counter their push with one of our own.

Things got more interesting with about 18 minutes to go when we noticed
that the Feds had no kills (score still 15-5). Since we were just
stockpiling armies, we decided to retreat to Ind and see how long we
could hold out. The base was soon filled up, and we started piling
up armies on other carriers and Rom, and the Feds still couldn't get
a kill (they had nearly 60 armies at this point, but couldn't use them).
For a while it looked like it might end that way, but with 8 minutes left
a Fed scummed a kill and the hunt was on.

The Feds retook Bet, Roms swarmed in and retook it, several other planets
were traded back and forth, and quite a few Fed carriers were slain. Rig
was taken by Feds in the last minute but immediately recaptured. In the
closing seconds, the Feds managed to recapture Bet, but the carrier for
Cet was crushed, and the game ended 14-6.

It was a weird game of denial. MO was basically sacrificing offense
and just defending their core, so Tubers didn't really have anything
to do but sit and wait for the final push to come, and the only counter
seemed to be to delay that final push as long as possible. The net
effect was a lot of sitting around for most of the game, which was
kind of boring. I saw this sort of thing coming about 2 years ago
and I hope that we can show that it doesn't really work, because I
wouldn't want lots of netrek games to be like that. From what I've
seen, I don't think the big stockpile strategy works as long as the
other team saves some armies too, because you have to sacrifice a
space controller to defend the stockpile. That means that you have
the armies, but you can't get anywhere with them, so you're not
really better off than if you had everyone space controlling.

Anyway, stats follow.

Original?  Nope, one of the articles Steve Sheldon posted a few weeks ago 
(something like GREATEST MOMENTS IN NETREK HISTORY) described how they 
were short players in a game vs. ET.  It was 8 on 6, but one of them was

out of the game and played 8 on 5 (good choice!).  I don't remember the

details, but I think they didn't bomb at all and concentrated on 
saving core armies until the last few minutes of the game.  For the

anywhere near core.  When the game started winding down, Tim Wonanywhere 
near core.  When the game started winding down, Tim Wong found 
someone to base, and one ET quit, so it was 7 on 6, and they made a big 
push, taking them to overtime and then the eventual win.  I think in 
Vlad's post, he refers to this game.

14-6 is one planet short of 13-7, which is pretty much a solid win, not a
thorough spanking.  Looking at the personnel on both teams, it makes
perfect sense to me why they'd want to gloat, even a little.

That depends on your victory conditions. I'm certain that if a team like
Footlocker played MO to a 14-6 score, that MO could say easily that they
played a very good game, and would be able to hold their heads up high.
While I'd never compare Tubers to Footlocker, from the standpoint of MO,
that could easily be the same feeling that they had...

Them gloating would not have pissed me off. Our team not crushing them
would be more of what I'd have trouble dealing with.

I'd be proud. Alot of teams have tried to hold core against really strong
teams, and failed.

Improving in a game with such a wide parity is next to impossible - there
is no frame of reference from which to learn anything.  It's like trying
to learn to drive when you haven't even learned what movement is - it's
meaningless.

If anyone would learn anything, it'd be you guys, because if you couldn't
get a higher score than 14-6, then there is room for improvement.

Note: This is not meant to be inflammatory, but this is pretty much the
first time I've ever seen a top-rated team complain about opponents that
they were supposed to crush, and didn't.

No, real clue getting separated from the chumps happens when
people form large tedious cluestacks and then whine about being
bored because they're so much better than the other team.

Jesus, you get what you pay for.

Er, no.  See, the game's not played to provide Polamreddy Reddy V
the satisfaction of genociding a bunch of hapless goats who had
the audacity to try to form a decent, fun at large team.  The
game's played to do the best you can.  In fact, it's a lot stupider
to be proud of being on a big stupid cluestack than it is to
be proud that you finished 14-6 against unreasonable odds.

>What kind of moron exults in getting crushed?

You fail to grasp.  They didn't get crushed.  No matter how hard
you tried, they devised an entirely successful strategy which made
sure that they did not, in fact, get ruinously defeated.  Even if
they didn't plan to win, I applaud those guys for figuring out a
way to piss you off.

So they rationalized it because they were slightly embarrassed.  Big
deal.  You're going to get even more of the sort of stuff you deem
lame, tedious and unfun as long as you continue to promote and create
lame, tedious and unfun cluestacks.  There is not a lot here that is
particularly hard to understand.

>I think they felt compelled to defend their core and felt proud in doing so.

I'm as competitive as anyone in the entire known universe, and I'll be
the first to say that if I had been on that team, I'd have been in the
BB behind the planet sending the SMACK messages like they were candy.
You expected to take core and geno; you were denied.  Since the structure
of your team was designed for massive overkill, clearly that was the
only thing in the game that could be contested.  They won, you lost.
I believe 12AM (which I think William was on, with me, if I'm not
mistaken) was once howling with exuberation and laughter after we
managed to hold the last planet against some big CMU strokefest team.
It's a great feeling.  What you think of it is irrelevant.

This is very stupid sounding coming from someone on a ponderous yawner
of a cluestack.  Get down into the trenches and play on a first year
team before you start mouthing platitudes about how people play netrek.
Teams like that are weakest in collecting large numbers of smug clue.
Boy, what fun it is to learn that, eh?

No, the most boring games in INL history have been the genos, which have
uniformly not taught anyone a damn thing. 

You'll forgive me for not feeling sorry for a whining bully.  Jesus,
you won 14-6.  Move on with your life, man.

Hm, I don't recall saying much of anything.  I was rather amused by
the whole discussion, actually.  :)  Seriously, though, your
stragety was a "losing" one... or at least, it was severely flawed.

You claim that the only "chance" you had was to stockpile and then
make for the push.  Well, perhaps so.  But keeping a 60 army
stash while huddling in core isn't very smart.  Against Tubers
who have superior space control and df'ing abilities, going from
5-15-0 to 9-11-0 to force OT is no easy task.  You should have kept
the game at 7-13-0 or 6-13-1 in order to have a chance to push for
OT.  That is, you should have used your planet stash but kept your
+25 on base.  From our point of view, your satisfaction with maintaining
your core 5 planets was equivalent to admitting defeat.  And some of
us felt that the game was not "worthwhile" because of that.

Our change of strategy midgame was in response to your army stash.
Even the best full-team base oggs will have a hard time killing
an enemy base sitting on homeworld with 7 defenders who res
next to him.  And our ogg coordination was pretty poor, so that
didn't help us.  We neuted/took your core agri a couple of times,
and easily SC dropped your backfield planets (neuting and taking
a few times), but those planets weren't easily defensible or
worthwhile with your 60+ army stash, so we stopped.  The only
way to counter the unlikely possibility of a last minute push
from your part was to do kill control and stash our own armies.
If you read the logs, you'll see that around 7 or so minutes remaining
we had at least 3-4 "carriers" and a full base, with a total army
count of at least 40.  By retreating to Ind and ASW'ing, we
opened up your core and spread your defenses.  This gave us
the opportunity to push into your core (I took Vega, dropping
8 armies on it, and others took/neuted/attempted the remaining
planets).  You countered, but the end result was that you
couldn't keep the planets you took.  And when we ran low on
armies, you didn't have the time to take more.  Hence the end
result of 14-6-0 Tubers.  I don't think you ever got more than
7 planets in the last minutes, and you had trouble keeping that,
even.

Anyway, it was interesting to plasma smack repeated oggers while
carrying 10 armies.  I haven't seen that much SMACK in an INL
game in a long time... in fact, ever.  :)  I even considered
getting an AS+20, but AS's don't have SMACK! :)

This brings to mind that STNG episode where Data plays that game with the 
strategy wizard dude. Where he specifically plays not to win.

Preddy has been there, I was on the team with him. The Ohio state team. But 
there are different views on the game. I know that when I used to row crew I 
rowed to experience rowing, not to win other schools tanks. Playing netrek not 
to win, but to just play is in my opinion the true zen of netrek.

I agree, seeing a geno is nothing more than looking at yesterday's news. Teams 
have been there did it done it. I'd rather see games where the balance enables 
both teams to play for a highly contested OT. There are many things at fault 
here. The game promotes genos, the teams promote genos, the strategies used in 
a game where a geno is the most likely end are boring.

   MO hardly gave us a challenge.

Then what's yer beef?  It looks to me like they did -- they challenged you
to crack their core, and you failed.  They challenged you to ogg their base
and you failed.  They challenged you to bomb their stash, and you failed.

One vote for blind stupidity.

   we were not running around in fear of losing to them.

That's not the point.  They denied you what you came for.  Two votes for
blind stupidity.

   I don't think what MO did in that game represented any sort of
   willingness to even engage us.

Why should they go out and get beat up by you tough guys?  As has been
mentioned before, you seem to be whining that they refused to play to your
strengths.  I have yet to see one good reason why they should do that.

One vote for willful ignorance.

   You can in no way shape or form compare [Tubers] to [Rebel Alliance or
   Superior Firepower]. 

Seems to me he did just that.  Two votes for willful ignorance.

   Those teams were formed almost solely on the basis of winning the
   champsionship.  When me, Al, and Andy decided to form this team, we
   gathered people not only to be competitive but also to have fun. 

He wasn't talking about some past incarnation of Tubers/Maggots/whatever you
used to call yourselves.  He was talking about the current tedious cluestack
(tm FSG).  Look, if you hadn't raided Babes for their best fighters, if you
hadn't recruited Erik so heavily you might have more of an argument.  The
core of you, Grey Elf, Dan, ztfeng is not the cluestack we're trying to
point out to you.  It's when you decide to supplement that with every tough
guy you can lay hands on that you come to resemble R.A. (or Heroes).

Three votes for willful ignorance.

   Tubers/Maggots have won an INL championship already

With a different lineup and summer doesn't count anyway.

One vote for genetic defect.

   Hands down, the two best bombers in INL history:
   1) Bert
   2) Garrett

Err, the two best *active* bombers, yeah.  Forget that wildman invented the
art, did you?  [Four votes for willful ignorance.]

Look, I've been bombing 8 INL seasons and I still hope to be as good as
Garrett someday.  I learned about three zillion tricks from him and every
time I thought I knew all his tricks he pulled a new one on me.  Bert wrote
the book on the basics (sadly now lost; I emailed him earlier this season
'cause it's not in his archives and he said it was gone).

But let's face it: Felix made SC bomber zones of control a real working
strategy; he's the one from whom I learned trash talk and attitude.  He
currently sucks 'cause he's out of shape.  But even at the height of his CTS
he could take his SC and dance on your scalp any time you dared fly an SC.
You'd be the worst ACC machine since Dr Doome dared fly an SC in a
clue-pickup game.

Three votes for blind stupidity.

   Take out CMU from FL, and you guys get thumped year in and year out.

TUS, 4-0-0 record, no CMU players.  Given he could have found that from the

How can he forget something no one but you ever knew?

Read the archives where Bert says:

"Anti-scout warfare is not new.  The second day I was scout bombing on
bronco (and people around here say that I invented the role), Exxon
Valdez was on the other team and spent a lot of time intercepting and
killing me.  At the time I was very happy to be occupying the time of          
such a great player, figuring that keeping Terence busy would help my
team a lot.  Only later did I realize that Terence was taking planets
using the kills that I provided.  Since then I've often seen
well-meaning scout bombers truly help the opposing team by giving away         
easy kills.  Running is important.  If you're forced to run so much
that you can't bomb at all, that's not your fault:  your team just             
needs an additional bomber.  Crippling the zero-kill anti-bomber is of
course ideal, and I've gotten a little better at it from playing               
hockey, but it's still damn hard.  "

Where did you get the idea that Tim invented the art of SC
bombing?
