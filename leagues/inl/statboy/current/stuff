The tie-breaking system is the same one we use every season.
These tie-breakers are applied in sequence until one team drops off the
*bottom*.  They are then *reapplied* from the beginning if 2 or more teams
remain.

1: Head-to-head
2: Fewest planets AGAINST (cumulative opponent's planet totals)
3: Most planets FOR (cumulative planet total)
4: Random selection

Note that 2 and 3 used to be reversed; that was changed about 2 years ago
when it was noticed that a 19-1-0 win got the same credit on the first
tiebreaker as a 19-0-1 geno.  We've never had to go past the second
tiebreaker.

In response to your implied question, Kevin, the GB-VD game is for the
second playoff spot.  If VD wins, they get the second slot at 3-1.  If
VD loses, we have a three-way tie at 2-2 between GB, VD, and HNIC.  
We can't apply head-to-head, because GB lost to HNIC, HNIC lost to VD, and VD 
would have lost to GB.  HNIC will be eliminated on the second tiebreaker
(planets against=46).  We then reapply from the start, and GB beats VD on
head-to-head.

First tiebreaker is head-to-head, then total planets against (least is
best), then total planets for (most is best). Tiebreakers are applied
in sequence until a lowest team can be removed, then one goes back to
head-to-head to resolve the remaining ties.

So, if GB, VD, and HNIC all ended 2-2, then the team with the most planets
against would end up 4th, and whoever won head-to-head of the remaining
two would be the second place team (and in the playoffs).

Currently:

	Games Left	PA	PF
HNIC	     0		45	34
VD	     1		21	38
GB	     1		31	27

So, If GB beats VD by a score of 15-4-1, or better, they get the
final playoff spot. HNIC can do no better than finish in 4th. 

Go GB!

Because of continued problems with the ftp.csua.berkeley.edu server, I
am now mirroring all the netrek FAQ's and the INL-related documents on
best.com.  You can access them with:

ftp://ftp.best.com/pub/doosh/netrek

I'm considering moving these permanently, but for now this will at least let
people access the information they need.
