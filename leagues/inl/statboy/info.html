<h1><center> Information about the sTaTbOy! Archives </center></h1>
<hr>

The information here, particularly the early history, may not be entirely
accurate.  -Dave<p>

The INL sTaTbOy!'s have been archiving statistics on games
ever since the conception of the INL in probably Fall 1991 or Spring 1992.
Initially, basic statistics, such as roster lists and team rankings/polls,
were recorded each season.  I'm not even sure if the currently
available statistics (such as Passing Wind's PWstats) were in
existence back then, and it seems likely that the sTaTbOy! title
and responsibilities were not seen as a separate "entity" from
the INL and INL Council.<p>

In Fall 1993, <a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~amueller">Andy Mueller</a>
was officially granted the sTaTbOy! title, and he expanded the archive to
include PW statistics, game results, official and unofficial rankings, and
other information, such as season schedules and team roster lists.  The
sTaTbOy! archives were probably accessible only through FTP initially,
since the World Wide Web was still in its infancy.<p>

Around this time, King Crimson wrote and submitted KCstats package to the
sTaTbOy!.  This KCstats package parsed the PWstat results of each game and
organized the statistics on a per-individual basis.  I'm not sure if this
package was available to Andy, but it was available to his successor.<p>

<a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~dearing/netrek.html">Greg Dearing</a>
(Porkchop) took over the prestigious title in Spring 1995.  During
his year, Greg invested a lot of time to make the sTaTbOy! archives more
useful and less time consuming.  There were modifications and additions
to the existing polls, some of which were based on ranking formulas
discussed on the Usenet newsgroup <a href="news:rec.games.netrek">
rec.games.netrek</a>.  The process of adding official game results to
the archives became almost completely automated.  To make the statistics
more readily accessible in a more visually appealing manner, Greg
placed the archives on the World Wide Web.  Due to time constraints,
however, he retired from his esteemed position in Fall 1995, thereby
passing the torch to me, <a href="../../index.html">Dave Ahn</a>.<p>

Since Sept 1995, I've expanded the sTaTbOy! archives to include
game summaries, recordings, and images.  In Jan 1996, the INL
Home Page and the sTaTbOy! archives were merged.<p>
