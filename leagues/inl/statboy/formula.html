<head><title> INL sTaTbOy! - Tops Scores Formula </title></head>
<h1><center> Top Scores Formula </center></h1>
<hr>
The player gets a score for each game based on the following formula:
<P>
score = ((tac*pad/100) + tpt + tpd + 2 * tpb + tek + pck + 3 * eck - 3 * acc) * (5 + tpf + tpn/2) / tof
<P>
Where tpf = total planets the players team owned at the end of game and tpn = total planets which were neutral at end of game.
<P>
His scores for each game are then tallied and divided by total minutes played.  This is an attempt to give credit to a player whose team was doing well while he was playing.  This also helps to counteract the generally higher statistics of losing teams.  Thanks to Erik Lauer for devising the basis for this scheme.
<P>
