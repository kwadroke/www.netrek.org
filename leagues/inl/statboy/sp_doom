Since no-one else wrote this up, I guess I will.  *SMACK!* Pack hosted
DOOM and did really well.

DOOM is a new team that seems quite enthusiastic.  They started showing up
an hour before the match, and 30 minutes before the game, they had 8
players and 2 coaches.  *SMACK!* (as usual) couldn't get enough players,
so Scott, Rob, chafey subbed in.  I doubt Alex Nielson could stop drewling
:) Oh yeah, I was there too (I don't belong in the same sentence as Rob)

A time out was called when they were down to just a few planets, about ten
minutes into the game.  Rob and chafey offered to switch, and gave them
many suggestions.  They didn't want our advice, and as for switching, one
of them said "we don't want charity."  DOOM probably thought we were trash
                            ^^^^^^^
talking them, but that really wasn't the case.  Scott noticed how bad
their pings were early, and suggested they hit '+' and tried explaining
UDP, which they might have found insulting.  If anyone from DOOM reads
this, most good players don't put down newbies.  Scott noticed his own UDP
was off and made the suggestion to you - only one DOOM had better lag than
Excalibur, a modem player from Canada...(umm there's no way all of DOOM is
on PPP is there? *cringe*)  And another thing, recognizing logins helps out.
Hero is Spaceace!, chafey is Hoser, scottt is GREEN ELF, cs922253 is RAIDEN.
We didn't have damouth :)

After we resumed, the game lasted until the 25 minute mark.  Scott was
really bored.  He brought the base to their backwall core agri and started
picking.  We gave up 4 ACC, but incredibly, we had 2 ACK.

Some tips for DOOM:
* Don't ogg Spaceace! in his own core
	Both Spaceace! and Hoser suggested you bomb aggressively (and
	save up for your core agri)  You want to bomb to force us to
	go back to pick up, and to have a ship in our space.  The
	galactic map only shows ships a certain distance from your
	team, so if you're in your own core, we can pick our quadrant
	without you knowing it.  You're giving up a free kill and a
	valuable position if you try to ogg Spaceace! in his own core,
	because 99.9925% of the time you'll fail.  (Don't pay any
	attention to Rob's 16 PAD, that must be a mistake :))

* Watch the galactic
	The bomber(s) should be calling when Spaceace! picks up, and
	it's a good idea to then keep track of where he is and try to
	delay him and signal for help if you're one-on-one or try to
	kill him if you out-number him (by a lot).  You also want to
	keep track of ships that don't carry, because a lot of times
	we cloaked and flew around in your core without armies to get
	you to waste valuable fuel. You might also want to practice 
	killing cloakers at vlsi.  I seriously just hit lock-on,
	maxwarp and cloak every time I carried and trusted you to not
	see me, or to miss.  And you did.  Your lag has something to
	do with this to.

The first game ended so quickly that we played again.  chafey decided not
to participate in the euthanasia (he's not karim, after all, hehe) and Alex, 
the *SMACK!* captain opted to sit out.  We played 7 on 8 and sometimes 7 
on 9, and Rob flew around at warp 0 whenever they had a bust to help even 
out the sides a bit more, but well, you know.

*SMACK!* got off to a slow start.  Fisher took the base, I scummed kills off
their bombers and started picking, and the other 6 flew into third space.
Apparently Rob and Scott didn't notice they picked red instead of blue this
time.

Their base died really fast.  A *SMACK!* got caught napping and maxwarped
into their base, and shot a lot.  I saw that and followed up.  Scott 
finished it off.  After that, Rob escorted Scott to take all their 
remaining planets.  DOOM might want to spend some time on a base practice
server (megalag or vlsi are two I play at), and/or recruit a base.

We called a time-out somewhere along the line.  Their captain called one 
too when he saw us call it.  When one side calls a timeout, the games 
pauses when everyone is in green alert or after a few minutes.  The other 
side does not need to do anything/can not do anything to prevent this.  
You only get one time-out, and you don't want to waste it like this.  "Pause"
is a related command.  It's normally used for emergencies, such as a few 
slots get busted.  We kept pausing cos Rob was keeping track of DOOM's
busts.  "Free" is the command to clear up a busted slot.

Wierd thing is they got hit by plague 4 times this game, and 3 times the
previous one, which reminds me of Hugh's > 100% of armies lost due to
mess-ups post two months ago.

Some tips for *SMACK!*
* Hey Alex, don't get too excited.  We're not going to sub for you all 
  the time :)  Besides, if you poke fun of DOOM too much, they might
  disband before SIN get's a chance to geno them.  Then I'd give you SO
  MUCH CRAP!

Some tips for DOOM:
* Don't fly around in a DD
	I won't try to give an explaination, because I haven't been
	able to convince anyone	from acs.ryerson.ca to trade up to a
	cruiser :(

* Leave core
	The further away you intercept us, the less chance we have of
	sync'ing for a good genocide wave.  You should also prefer to
	fight us closer to your former front-line than to wait for us
	to fly into your core.  If we are in your core, you have to
	kill us, even if it takes you 10 ships to do it (or in my case
	you can just kill me with 1 SC).  If you don't leave your core
	to fight us, then we can obviously go into your core.  At that
	point, if you don't fight us very aggressively, then we can bomb.
	I bombed 10 armies - which you could have used to take 2 or more 
	planets.  And, flying around in enemy core lets us set up to escort 
	carriers.  As well, DOOM was hanging on to it's own kills way too 
	much.  When they were down to just homeworld and DRA@7,  I cloaked.
	3 ships sitting on DRA ran away from me.  I bombed.  DOOM
	needed those 3 armies a lot more than it needed 3 1-kill ships.
	I don't mean to brag, because it's no big deal - Spaceace! would
	have just killed all three of you and bombed - I just wanted
	to point this out because:
	a) good players know when they have to risk their kills
	b) better players ignore their kills
	c) all three of you wanted to fight over those armies?
	d) any one of you should be able to kill me if you bothered
	   to try, let alone three of you.  But you all ran away...
