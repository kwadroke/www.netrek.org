<p><h2 id="IMHO">IMHO</h2>
<p>
Analysis of Planet Takes is an 
easy place to start reviewing the tactics employed in Netrek. The goal 
of the take is simple for both teams and so the success of any Planet 
Take is easily measured - was the planet taken by the attacking team? 
lost due to the actions of the defending team? or saved by the 
defending team? On the face of it there is little difference between a 
planet being won by the attacking team and a planet being lost by the 
defending team except who is responsible for the change in the galactic 
layout.</p>

<p>
With a broad view on the game the attacking team 
loses nothing if they fail to take the planet, but the defending team 
will lose a whole lot. Planet Takes ARE Netrek. Planet Takes are 
a tiny little microcosm within the bigger Netrek simulation, and 
reviewing Planet Takes can probably tell us a lot about playing as a 
team and winning at Netrek.</p>

<p>
The way Planet Takes often unfold is that the a 
ship that is carrying will target a planet and call the Take to the 
team. Escort precedes the Taker to the Planet and engages the defending 
ships. It is the Escort's role to beat back the defenders and to deal 
with oggers on the lead up to and during the Take. Remember your ship 
has phasers that can pick out ogging defenders, torpedos that can drive 
the enemy away from areas of space, and shields that can be raised or 
lowered to distribute damage or allow refueling and repair. After the 
planet is Taken (yes, you blinked and missed it) that planet is 
vulnerable to those ships that were not involved in defending against 
the Take. Since the planet was lost there must have been <i>some</i>
ships on the defending team following some other agenda, otherwise 
what is the excuse for the defending team losing the planet in the 
first place??! If the planet was saved then the defenders have been 
successful, so everyone flies around getting ready to do it again.
</p>

<p>
Let me rewrite that, inserting some additional 
possibilities to give you an idea how complex the process really can be:
</p>

<p>
The way Planet Takes often unfold is that the a 
ship that is carrying will target a planet or selection of planets and 
call the Take to the team for the planet where the Taker wants the 
escort to go. This planet may or may not be the intentional target, but 
for the purposes of the Take the Taker is the grand master of illusion. 
With assistance from the attacking team members the Taker will create 
an artiface to present to the defending team and in this way will 
increase the likelihood of Taking the real target planet. Escort 
precedes the Taker to the Planet and engages the defending ships, or 
will push them from the area, or will Ogg the defending Star Base, or 
will threaten the last remaining horde of armies, or will cloak and 
threaten a more likely target to draw defening ships, or will tie up 
the carriers on the defending team who will probably selfishly call for 
escort, or any number of a billion other strategies depending on the 
circumstances of the respective teams. It is the Escort's foremost role 
to beat back the defenders and to deal with oggers on the lead up to 
and during the Take, thus allowing the Taker to reach orbit and beam 
down. Everything else is secondary to the goal of taking the planet. 
Play with the view that taking a planet is like scoring a goal in a 
ball-sport. The Taker may feint towards the planet and then veer off, 
causing all hell to break loose in high orbit. The defenders may charge 
or be split up as some engage the planet or empty their fuel tanks 
prematurely, ejaculating torpedos into the vaccuum in a frantic rush of 
concern. The Taker may be cloaked or uncloaked for effect. The Taker 
will be calling the targets as appropriate, probably giving priority to 
the bigger ships with more powerful weaponry. The Taker will be dodging 
phasers by warping at moderate speeds to regions of space where the 
phaser has already been shot. The Taker may detonate some random single 
torpedos and then move away from the area to create the impression that 
the defending team should be focussing their attention there. With 
luck, escort, hasty actions by the defending team, and the grace of the 
god of net-lag the Taker reaches the planet and stops being 
maneouverable and in control of its own future. All events up to this 
point have been with the aim of reducing the defenders firepower and 
their commitment to the task of defending the planet. The Taker orbits 
while bombing existing armies until the planet has no more than 4 
remaining on the surface. This is best done in an Assault Ship but 
Takers cannot be choosers, and Team Captains don't always get their 
way. The Taker then deposits the armies from its hold onto the planet, 
which may or may not be in the process of breeding new armies (POP!). 
The Taker may be raising shields to distribute damage, detting errant 
torps, or just sitting with their eyes closed counting off the seconds. 
The Taker may be killed during or after the planet has been neutralised 
or taken. After the planet is Taken that planet is either safe or 
vulnerable. The enemy may have been serious in the defense to the point 
that the attacking armada is now a remnant of its former glory and the 
planet has only been neutralised. If the planet is neutralised then it 
is an obvious target and it may be best to leave it neutralised if it 
takes the focus away from a more strategic take - an Agricultural world 
or a world with Fuel and Repair facilities on or close to the front 
line is much easier to retain than a barren lump of rock hanging 
motionless in space. If the defending team has one ship out of action 
as it ferries armies to the less-important neutralised planet then so 
much the better for the attacking team. Remember that the roles of the 
attacking and defending teams are largely defined by who is currently 
doing the push and that this changes from second to second. If the 
Taker is alive and the escort is alive and the planet is won then the 
Take is a victory since there are ships that can control the space 
around the planet, or move from their far forward position to foil the 
plans of the once-defending team who may now be carrying and lining up 
a counter strike. [eot]</p>

<p>
Let me rewrite that, paraphrasing to display the behaviour often 
encountered:</p>

<p>
"Woohoo! I just got a kill! I'd better pick up... where's a 
planet. I'll leave that teammate crippled in space and warp back home 
to get those two armies. Oh, hold on, we were just taking a planet 
weren't we? Oh well, I'm sure our guys will be fine. Ok, now home... 
that's funny, how did all these guys get back here so fast? They can be 
my escort. I'd better call the Take with CTRL+T while I am all the way 
back here and then go straight there at max warp. Coolness, now I'm 
almost a the planet I will cloak. Onto the planet we go. No fair! How 
did they know where I was! Why aren't my team here? Everything's 
spinning... phasers... torpedos... why am I uncloaked? Who's pulling me 
off the planet!?! Argh!!" [boom] "F0 -&gt; FED Where were you 
all?"</p>

<p><h2 id="Ideas">Get the idea?</h2>
<p>
There are many more ways to lose 
a planet than there are to take a planet. The Taking team merely has to 
drop armies on the planet until it changes colour. The defending team 
must stop this from happening, but they don't necessarily know exactly 
where or when it will happen. It is the goal of the attacking team to 
make the odds favour the carrier in the Take. Subterfuge, bullying, 
lying and outgunning are all acceptable tactics to use during a Take. A 
defender with a critical eye on the galactic map during a Take can 
often detect such subterfuge. Always 
remember that the Taker will at some point in the Planet Take be a 
"sitting duck" orbiting a planet with shields down. There is 
no other way to beam down armies! Solitary takes against defended 
planets do not favour the Taker at all. These Takes leave the Taker 
exposed and susceptable to premature death.</p>

<p>
At the other end of the scale is where the Taker 
drops armies onto a planet unopposed. The easiest planet takes are the 
best since they advance your team without undue risk or a negative 
change in the fortunes of your team. Unexpected Planet Takes by your 
team are excellent in that they demoralise the enemy and break down the 
enemy cohesion: "How did I miss <i>that</i>?" or "My 
team <i>sucks</i>!"</p>

<p>
Complications arise when the target planet is 
hotly contested. Since the Taker is vulnerable, the Taker must work 
with their team to cause the enemy to waste fuel, fly in irrational 
directions, chase after decoys, and end up crippled and out of play for 
a while. Generally the attacking team must try to make the defending 
team work against themselves. The defending team can deal with this by 
engaging the enemy Taker early and ignoring the escort. When defending 
the act of wasting ships to the Escort <i>can</i> be useful if you 
outgun the attacking team but more often you will be playing into the 
hands of the enemy who may just pull out and move to a different target 
far from your home world where you appear with your fresh ship.</p>

<p><h2 id="Notes">Notes on the Take File</h2>
<p>
The colour maps on the early animations make the 
Romulan team coloured Yellow, like FED or a sickly shade of green. This 
is largely OK because the ship types are clearly Romulan.</p>

<p>
The animations here are manually captured on a 
Windows 95 workstation (I've lost most of you already - victims of a 
holy war). Two types of grabs have been taken. Some are of the local 
Tactical windows and some include the Galactic, Message, and Player 
list. The Tactical view animations do not answer such strategic 
questions as "Why is F6 chasing after K4?". They are 
presented for comment on how to perform tasks. The full animations are 
capable of answering such broad scale questions.  The 
message window will signal the intentions of both teams, the 
statistics/player windows will show the state of each of the ships, and 
the galactic will show you the state of play at the time the snapshots 
are taken. Note that the short term fortunes of war rarely tell the 
full story, so I'm compiling a complete review of a 2 hour INL rules 
game from April 1997 for publishing here later this year to give a 
slightly different perspective on planet takes in relation to winning 
and losing the game.</p>

<p>
The animations here are animated GIFs. The current ones have a 1 second 
delay between frames. These can be pulled apart and recompiled with 
different options or in a different format by most current graphic 
utilities and I encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>
Some animations do not portray Takes but do illustrate some ship to 
ship behaviour. Not all animations currently have commentary. Feedback 
suggestions and text as appropriate.</p>

	<b>Comments:</b>
	<ol>
		<li>

		<b>Strategic:</b>
		<ol>
			<li>
			O7 initially carries, and could 
			either trust the rest of the team to defend Pol while O7 agresses at 
			Arc or Spi. This would be the proactive approach to the situation. 
			Instead O7 participates in the planet defense. This could be for a 
			number of reasons: with the focus on the one planet, Pol, O7 is 
			guaranteed escort since it is clear where everyone's attention lies; 
			none of the other team members need to juggle the dual responsibility 
			of attacking and defending at two places simultaneously; the skill 
			level of the other players; the time remaining in the game; the number 
			of players on the team.
		</li></ol>
		</li><li>
		<b>Tactical:</b>
		<ol>

			<li>
			O7 plinks the planet with Plasma to 
			drive away the Federation ships [3326 &amp; 3384]. The tactic works in 
			that F5 is cautious in the assault and sees a threat causing F5 to pull 
			out [3330], allowing the Orions to establish a presence in the area. 
			Unfortunately for the Orion team, the delay also allows the Federation 
			ships to consolidate their position [3360 onward].
			</li><li>
			The Torp Storm over Pol also ensures 
			the taker, DD F5, will move off the planet or die. The torps are fired 
			early enough by O7 and O0 so that the wobble distributes the torps in a 
			cloud. This "<a href="torpcage.gif">torpcage</a>" 
			is displayed more clearly in <a href="torpcage.gif">this 
			unrelated example</a>. The idea behind a torpcage is that 
			"if you Det you die". If you fail to Det you must wear torps.
			</li><li>
			F2 escorts F5 by engaging the heavier 
			ship BB O4 [3322 to 3329] and drawing fire from it.
			</li><li>

			F2 provides a decoy for F5 as F5 
			pulls out from Pol.
			</li><li>
			F5 decloaks and assists in clearing 
			the planet. Even though F5 is carrying, the odds of the Take being 
			successful are enhanced with more active participation.
			</li><li>
			The DD's are flying time bombs. F5 
			and F2 are both weak ships who explode due to damage received in the 
			line of duty. F2 is detting for F5 and is killed in a chain explosion 
			as the BB O4 barrels onto the scene [3396]. F5 is in orbit and unable 
			to dodge the still-alive O4. The escort needed to be spaced further 
			apart and O4 needed to be destroyed to leave F5 in the area controlling 
			at Pol.
			</li><li>
			The ships refueling on the planet are 
			sitting ducks for the enemy ships [3345 &amp; 3379]. Their trajectories 
			are predictable and their fuel state is broadcast to anyone who cares 
			to read the signs. O3 and O4 both do this during the take.
			</li><li>
			O7 refuels by dodging at low speeds. 
			O7 will shortly regain the planet since the Federtion ships cannot 
			control it following the Take. Overall the Federation team lose the 
			planet and their carrier because of one Battleship.

<b>File</b> BET60: [<a href="LocalFedTakeBetAgainstOri.gif">Animation</a>] <br>
  In which SC R0 and AS R6 take Beta Crucis with opposition from 
SC O4 and DD O3.</p>
<p>
<b>Notes:</b></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	The defending and escorting ships are all light weight, Scouts and a 
	Destroyer, compared to the taker, who is in an Assault Ship.
	</li><li>
	R0 clears Beta Crucis by destroying the cloaked defender O4. R6 follows 
	making a beeline for Beta Crucis. R0 scans the planet and then 
	intercepts and dies to O4, but O4 has pulled R6 off Beta Crucis by this 
	point. R6 reestablishes orbit and takes the planet as O3 returns. R0 
	returns as well and finishes O3.
	</li><li>
	O4 is attempting to "trapdoor" either the escort or the 
	taker. The position is wrong, however. There is a clear tendency for 
	pilots to fire at cloaked objects by using visible objects as targets. 
	In this instance the trapdoor ship is directly between the escort and 
	the planet. Death is swift. When cloaking to Ogg, consider positioning 
	yourself in an area of comparative vacuum, and consider only engaging 
	while other of your team mates are around to give the target a false 
	Red Alert. If you are being fired upon while cloaked, raise your 
	shields if you anticipate a P-lock or a torp collision.

	<font color="#999999">(3)</font></p>
	</li><li>
	R6 does not cloak and so is easily delayed by the defenders as they 
	pluck him off Beta Crucis.
	</li><li>
	R0 scans Beta Crucis rather than engaging the remaining defender, O4. 
	The result is that the two ships R0 and O4 explode quite close to R6. 
	R6 has shields raised at this point, however.

<b>File</b> ERI56: [<a href="LocalKliTakeEriRomPoorDefense.gif">Animation</a>] <br>

In which DD K2 and BB K7 take Eridani with opposition from SC R1 and DD 
R6.</p>
<p>
<b>Notes:</b></p>
<ol>
	<li>
	This can be considered an "unopposed" take, as the defending 
	ships are in inappropriate positions with incorrect vectors throughout 
	the approach and drop.
	</li><li>
	The escort, K7, is not in a position to detonate incoming torps. K7 
	serves throughout the take as a deterrent to R6, who turns tail and 
	runs from the larger ship quite early.
	<p>
	<img src="970106_eri_a.png" width="279" height="251" alt="">

	 <br>
	<font color="#999999">(1, 2, 3 &amp; 4)</font></p>
	</li><li>
	The ship "weights" favour the takers.
	</li><li>
	North of Eridani is galactic edge, so no assault can arrive from there. 
	K7 is on the wrong side of the planet, and only serves to draw fire 
	from R1. When firing at a cloaked player, the attacker will often use 
	visible objects as the first targets.
	</li><li>
	K7 is a BB and could have used pressors to drive R1 away from the area 
	surrounding the planet.
	<p>

	<br>
	<img src="970106_eri_b.png" width="177" height="108" alt="">
	 <br>
	<font color="#999999">(4 &amp; 5)</font></p>
	</li><li>
	Because the escort is on the far side of the planet, the torps launched 
	by K7 are a threat to the team mate K2. If R1 had intended to destroy 
	K2 by dying at the planet while K2 was still in the area, or by 
	charging K7, the torp stream K7 released could have been detonated by 
	R1 and K2 would take damage. Avoid firing over the top of cloaked 
	companions if the threat is in close proximity. In this case, R1 sees 
	the torp stream as a threat rather than a tool, and so dodges northward 
	away from the ship with kills.
	<p>

	<img src="970106_eri_c.png" width="140" height="65" alt="">
	 <br>
	<font color="#999999">(6)</font></p>
	</li><li>
	While cloaked, K2 makes 6 course corrections. The net result is that 
	the periodic exploding torpedos against K2's shields do not serve to 
	allow R1 to attain a lock.
	<p>
	<img src="970106_eri_d.png" width="146" height="185" alt="">
	 <br>

	<font color="#999999">(7)</font></p>
	</li><li>
	R1 shoots wildly. The phaser shots appear to be attempts to locate K2 
	rather than to do any damage. One method is to search out a 
	Phaser-lock, which will remain for a couple of updates, and use the 
	position information from that shot to get an idea where to send torps. 
	R1, however aims too high. Assuming K2 touches the planet and attains 
	orbit at the closest point to K2's last visible position (which 
	happened), K2 could not have been high on the west side of the planet, 
	at R1's extreme range of phaser distance. This is a reasonable 
	assumption to make based on the torpedo detonations on the cloaked 
	ship. The cloaked ship MAY have been detonating the torpedos, however. 
	The shot is hopeful, but wild.

<p>
<b>Notes</b>:</p>
<ol>

	<li>
	Consider these to both be unopposed takes. The Klingons are reacting to 
	the threat at Eridani initially, not already guarding the planet. Once 
	R0 is dead from bearing two converging torp streams on it's unshielded 
	hull, the planet is easily recovered by the Klingons. K2 drops and

In which SC R1 takes Lalande while being chased by AS K5.</p>
<p>

<b>Notes</b>:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	K5 loses the plot, floating westward in the vacuum until the point 
	where Lalande is taken. This triggers a resurgence of interest in 
	attacking R1.
	</li><li>
	R1 drives K5 off by decloaking and directing a stream of 8 torps at K5. 
	Scout torps cause 25 points damage if they hit, K5 has raised shields 
	(80 points) and a hull strength of 100. K5 will lose shields if it 
	dodges the wrong way or stays on course pursuing R1. The alternative is 
	to detonate the torps and wear the reduced damage, which in the best 
	case is 50 points. In any case, K5 has no hope of catching R1.
	</li><li>
	In the ideal case, K5 would have charged the planet instead of drawing 
	off from the chase at around frame 950. The only positive outcome would 
	have been to destroy R1 as it orbited or was accelerating.

<p>
<b>Notes</b>:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	The initial neutralisation of Cygni was uncontested. R6 used pressors 
	against a team member to attain more speed to defend F0 against K4 and 
	assist in controlling at the planet.

	 <br>
	<font color="#999999">(1)</font></p>
	</li><li>
	K2 "pinwheels" on Cygni for a period. This is where a ship 
	will sit on a fuel planet, firing torps into the vaccuum at distant 
	ships. It is a bad idea as it makes your ship's movements predictable - 
	if you don't move you will continue to orbit, if you do move you will 
	start from rest. The best way to break orbit when under threat is to 
	pressor or tractor yourself off and up to speed, or to cloak and then 
	depart in an unexpected direction.
	<p>
	<img src="pinwheel.gif" width="48" height="44" alt="">

	 <br>
	<font color="#999999">(2)</font></p>
	</li><li>
	The fallout from the battle gives K4 a kill, who then carries to Cygni. 
	The "Escort" enthusiastically engages the enemy at this 
	point, crowding the taker, K4, and causing an unfortunate chain 
	explosion which ultimately engulfs the taker before the planet is 
	claimed.

	The suicide run by R6 is at maxwarp at the center of the planet. Once 
	again, even though the cloaker is invisible, it is undone by the 
	proximity to other visible objects as well as the commitment to an 
	existing course. K4 cloaks quite late and maintains a constant course. 
	K2 appears to have shields lowered. The ogger, R6 is also tractored by 
	the escort K2 who may be attempting to leave the area by getting up to 
	speed or may be attempting to draw R6 into their weapons range. Either 
	way the result is disastrous for Klingon.

In which DD K1 escorts DD K5, dying to CA R6 allowing Regulus to be 
taken by K5.</p>
<p>
<b>Notes</b>:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	The escort, K1, is positioned between K5 and the defender, R6. This 
	allows K1 to detonate the torps from R6. All of R6's weaponry is 
	ineffective with K1 blocking the view.
	</li><li>
	K5 doesn't cloak while on the planet, this allows R6 to break K5's 
	orbit.
