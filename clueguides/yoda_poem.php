<h2>Netrek</h2><br>
<p>a poem by Zachery Uram (Yoda/Hyperyoda), 2010-02-07</p>
<br>


Oh game sublime <br>
You enchant me still<br> 
<br>
With base oggs <br>
And delicate dogfighting skill <br>
<br>
A game so balanced <br>
In perfect harmony <br>
<br>
Strategic richness coupled <br>
With tactical mastery <br>
 <br>
Succeed as a team <br>
All acting as one <br>
 <br>
Conquer the galaxy <br>
And have much fun <br>
 <br>
But alas I doth lament <br>
At its slow and sad decline <br>
 <br>
Now go young newbies <br>
And learn a game truly divine <br>
 <br>
The more you invest <br>
Greater is the return <br>
 <br>
In netrek every fresh ship <br>
Is a chance to learn <br>
 <br>
So bring on the carriers <br> 
To doosh and escort <br>
 <br>
The core agri is popping <br>
Now for real sport! <br>
 <br>
May you phaser lock often <br>
And your torps aim true <br>
 <br>
Keep improving and growing <br> 
By observing old clue <br>
 <br>
Some will leave netrek <br>
In the fullness of time <br>
<br> 
For me it's transcendent <br>
Thus endeth my rhyme. <br>
</center>
