I don't think there is a universally optimal keymap. You will have to find
out what works best for you.
<P>
One of the weirdest keymaps and buttonmaps around is probably Lauer's:
<P>
buttonmap:  122%3p4s5x6g7f8d9gawb]cg
<P>
keymap:  qzamzx&lt;owzsbxxeRdpc;rDftvit]gdb[y_h^n&lt;u}j&gt;m{ifk0,Iorll.m`00)

<P>
They kinda speak for themselves, but what's most odd is that he has speed
on his mouse. Button 1 is warp 2, button 2 is maxwarp and button 3 is
turning (p is turning remapped which you can see in the keymap). He also  
relies on shift, ctrl and shift+ctrl, which I could never do -- I don't
think it's fast enough and not reliable enough.
<P>

My thoughts on creating a keymap is that you will want to rest your
fingers on the buttons you need to access at the shortest time. I rest my
left hand on <adsf>+<space> so therefore I will want the keys that I need
to hit in a great hurry when dogfighting on those five keys, and other
important keys very close to those four.
<P>
When designing your keymap, you will also have to remember that one finger
can only press one button at a time. Therefore if you, for instance, have
torps on &lt;f&gt;, you will not want to have some function you want to use
while torping on &lt;g&gt;, &lt;r&gt;, &lt;t&gt;, &lt;v&gt; or &lt;b&gt; which are the keys you also use
your index finger to hit.
<P>
I believe in keeping phaser, turning and something else (I used to have  
info when I was on a three button mouse) on the mouse.
<P>
Important keys to think about when designing your keymap:
<P>
<B>a) Warp keys.</B><BR>
   Speed changes while dogfighting is crucial, so therefore you will want
to have warp keys as close to your <asdf> default position as possible. I
have found that using only two keys for warp is was suits me best. When in
CA I have mapped &lt;s&gt; my base warp which is 3, and &lt;a&gt; is maxwarp; so I
just switch between those two the entire time while dogfighting. One might
validly argue that it is unnecesary to use both &lt;a&gt; and &lt;s&gt; for speed
changes since you don't ever want to hit both "base warp" and "maxwarp" at
the same time. But I switch between "base warp" and "maxwarp" so often
that I have found that keeping them on &lt;a&gt; and &lt;s&gt; is what works best for
me.
<P>
   I also have "warp 2" on &lt;q&gt; which I use when I need a good orbit (and
never while dogfighting).
<P>
<B>b) Tractor/Pressor</B><BR>
   Don't use toggles when it comes to tractor/pressor, if you do you will
find yourself seriously crippled when it comes to dogfighting in high lag.
In an intense dogfight, you will have to use your tractor/pressor more  
than 75% of the time. In really intense and quick dogfights (&lt;10 second
dogfights) I use my tractor/pressor the entire time, which is perfectly
alright since the tractor/pressor takes so little fuel
<P>
   I have "turn on tractor" on &lt;d&gt; and "turn on pressor" on &lt;g&gt;. I find
this is really good because since I am an aggressive dogfighter I will
want to fire (I have torps on &lt;f&gt;) and tractor at the same time. Since I
have pressor on the same finger as torps, there will be a one tick
delay between my pressor and torp stream, but that is perfectly alright
since pressor is most often a defensive manouver used to push yourself out
of the enemy torp stream, and should you torp while pressoring out of an
enemy torp stream, the enemy will have a very easy time dodging.
<P>
I have "turn off tractor/pressor" on e.
<P>
<B>c) Weapons</B><BR>
   The torps and phasers are probably the most important thing on your      
keymap. These two you will want on the most easiest accessible keys. With
a good keyrepeat, it is very easy to throw good torp streams, so therefore
I want my torps under my left index finger (&lt;f&gt; on my keyboard). I want my
phasers under my right index finger (left mouse button), so that I can
keep a rapid pace with my phasering.
<P>
   I don't believe in using the plasma in a CA in any other occasions than
just for fun (since it uses almost a third of the CA fueltank), so      
therefore I have my CA plasma on &lt;t&gt;, which is not too far away but still
not super-fast accessible either.
<P>
<B>d) Keymap</B><BR>
   My default (CA) keymap looks like this:
keymap: q2roW]yeuwfttfg^e$d_ da%s3wsnrvomX~m!cc{C}rljm
<P>
I hope this helps.
