Welcome!<P>
In the case someone stumbles here: <BR>
Netrek is a 16-player online game, open source & freeware. I invite you to visit <A HREF="http://www.netrek.org">www.netrek.org</A> to find resources and how to play. <P

This is an extremely fun and deep game. It the most difficult game to master that I am aware of. It is the only action/strategy game that I know of that some people have played for ten years or more.<P>

For the rest: collected resources on netrek dogfighting and strategy. <P>

This guide is a mix of practical information on layout and tactics with theory. <BR>
This guide is a mix of practical information on layout and tactics with theory. <BR>
Part I is theory on training properly, a hopefully useful intro. <BR>
Part II is theory and comment on doing damage.<BR>
Part III I discuss controls / setting keymap in extensive, useful detail.
Part IV is about deploying your best tools - tractor, pressor, phasers, and torps effectively<BR>
Part V provides analysis of specific situational tactics <BR>
Part VI is my proposal on how to approach dodging and movement while fighting.

If you see me online & sucking, and find yourself saying "why the hell should I listen to this guy?" just remember - anyone can get rusty. And were you EVER a 2.0+ offense top tier df? I was, and if you weren't - I can still tool your ass. ;)   (Hmm... tongue in cheek's a little tough to convey on a page - 'know?) <BR>
<P>
Good Luck,
