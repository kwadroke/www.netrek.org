<h1>Red Shirt's Game Plan, version 1</h1>
<p>
One volunteer (perhaps our most-lagged-player) will be a full-time
scout bomber.  Run around deep in enemy space, bomb the undefended
planets, and try not to die.  Don't get waylaid by other missions; even
if the captain calls a base og, you should often continue bombing
anyway (your option).  Other players will occasionally go up to help
bomb when the enemy has lots of scattered armies.
</p>

<p>
We will have a starbase fighting at or just behind the front.  It will
not hold many armies; its primary purpose is to provide space control.
The starbase should feel free to move up or back or wherever it likes;
if it retreats, please do not retreat with it; stay up and fight at the
front instead.  It's not a big loss if the starbase dies, but it should be
an asset to us, and we'll want a new one 30 minutes later.
</p>

<p>
Two designated players will alternate army-guard duty; i.e., they will
protect the homeworld army pile, and shuttle more armies to it.  When
you're on army-guard duty, feel free to roam around (e.g., to kill
bombers, pick up stray armies, or rescue teammates who are limping
home); you just have to be able to get back to the homeworld in time to
protect it (track all enemy ships in our space on the galactic, and
note their ship types).  If you screw up and get crippled out of
position, distress.  If you're at the homeworld and they're going to
try to bomb under you, orbit the planet so you can fire all you want
without running out of fuel.  I prefer to use a scout for army-guard
duty, because that lets me roam the farthest, but cruisers and
destroyers are acceptable.  When you get two or three kills, switch off
and let the other guy guard armies while you take (or fake) planets.
If you're NOT on army-guard duty, don't waste time and confuse the
guards by doing it!  (Krishna says "Prefer to die doing your own duty:
the duty of another will bring you into great spiritual danger.")
</p>

<p>
The other five or six players (including the off-duty army guard, and
the base player during construction) don't have roles; just play good
solid netrek.  Take planets when you can, bomb when you can, clear
planets for our takers, ogg potential carriers opportunistically (don't
fixate), phaser nearby enemies as if you were a borg, lob torps
at enemies that come toward you, dodge or det all enemy torpedos, and
watch the galactic.  When in doubt, just hustle to the front and blow
up some enemy ships.  Feel free to specialize, i.e. volunteer to
concentrate on one aspect of the game or one region of space.  Most of
these ships should probably be cruisers, because phasers are so
important, but scouts have advantages too, and I don't object to
other ship classes.
</p>

<p>
A few general things for everybody:
</p>

<p>
Read and heed the rare messages from the captain.
</p>

<p>
Don't clutter the team board with a lot of other messages, and
especially don't write criticisms.  You can send suggestions via
personal message to the captain, but primarily concentrate on
playing your ship the best you can.
</p>

<p>
Distress (once) the moment you beam up armies.  Call a destination
if you want, but mainly we'll be looking at the galactic and guessing
where you want to go (drop on the open planet please).
</p>

<p>
Try to synchronize attacks (e.g. base ogs or planet-crashing), i.e.
wait for stragglers and then attack at the same time (but from
different directions).
</p>

<p>
Follow the game plan even when we're not doing well.  I may have to
alter the plan for the next game, and I may be full of shit altogether,
but unless we actually follow the plan, we won't know.
</p>

<p>
In overtime, the game plan stays exactly the same.
