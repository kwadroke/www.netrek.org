<h1>SC notes from Dean Yasuda</h1>


<p>
These notes are from a Scout guide written by Dean Yasuda, and were included
in the version 1.x Netrek Newbie Guide but are now broken out seperately.

<p>In the examples in this guide, you are a ROM, opponents are FED.

<p>&nbsp;
<h4>
Q1: What is passive bombing?</h4>
A1: Passive bombing (also called positional-bombing) is a bombing strategy
in which the bomber focuses on being in a position to bomb enemy armies
that will pop in the future. The bomber dynamically maintains a position
deep in enemy territory that gives him bombing ownership of as many planets
as possible.

<p>&nbsp;
<h4>
Q2: When should I p-bomb?</h4>
A2: Whenever the enemy has more than five planets if nobody else is bombing.
In general, one bomber is all you want in a pickup game because there are
so few clueson the team that the others really need to be escorting, taking,
ogging, etc.

<p>&nbsp;
<h4>
Q3: Where is the best spot for a p-bomber?</h4>
A3: A lone p-bomber should try to live just below and right of ALP (center)
in order to control the six right and central planets. A secondary bomber
should lurk below and right of (VEG), pressuring the core while keeping
an escape route into third space.

<p>&nbsp;When the bomber has at least &frac34; fuel, he should lurk at
a minimum of warp 5, in order to win races to planets.

<p>&nbsp;
<h4>
Q4: What is the best path to enemy territory?</h4>
A4: Arcing through shallow third and fourth space is the best path to Fed
space. A bomber should avoid the front line if the enemy presence there
is strong. The wall-route is sometimes safe, but an attentive enemy CA
can sometimes expel or kill the scout.

<p>&nbsp;Maxwarp out of your core, slow to warp 9 while passing the front,
and arc narrowly around the enemy position. It is reasonable to let an
enemy CA chase you into toward third space; he is losing his position faster
than you are losing yours.

<p>&nbsp;Once you enter enemy territory, find a safe, effective place to
regenerate E-temp and fuel, and then optimize your position. If another
bomber is in the primary position, he will either shift to the secondary
position or play an aggressive or ogging role.

<p>&nbsp;
<h4>
Q5: What if they chase me?</h4>
A5: Run towards third space. Remember, as long as theyre chasing you they
cant do anything else for their team. If theyre really inept (say they
chase you mindlessly in a CA) you can still get some bombing done while
avoiding him. Dont let him kill you unless in dying you bomb his last armies.
The main reason he is chasing is probably that he wants a kill.

<p>&nbsp;
<h4>
Q6: When and how should a scout ogg?</h4>
A6: Ogg when bombing duties are covered and it is apparent that your ogging
help is needed. Never assume you can kill a good carrier; assume that you
can help a cruiser finish the job. Prep an oggee by light pelting, follow
just out of range until help arrives, or fake a bomb. A scout can aid cruiser
oggs by synchronization, following-up, netting, pre-pelting, or tailing
the enemy to prevent him from reaching safety in time.

<p>&nbsp;
<h4>
Q7: Tandem scout oggs are fun. Are there drawbacks to this?</h4>
A7: Yes, if it leaves the team without a bomber. It takes almost a minute
for a scout to establish bombing position. During this time, about three
armies will pop, and an enemy take can occur. If bombers ogg foolishly,
they may wind up playing catchup (ogging or arriving too late to bomb safely)
rather than destroying armies as they appear. Poor scout discipline is
almost a given in any game, and the results can be disastrous. Cruiser-scout
oggs drive the taker away from the front, even if they fail. The price
for a failed, double-scout ogg is often greater, and even a successful
ogg may be a losing proposition.
