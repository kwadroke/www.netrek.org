    <h1>Ogging 101</h1>

<a name="Ogging"></a>3.3 Ogging:</h3>
This is the art of killing a carrier, or potential carrier, by a suicide
run. The basic idea is to cloak before you get on his tactical, run up
to him until youre about half an inch away, then tractor-phaser-torp-torp-torp
until he dies. Ogging is a simple tactic and any dummy can do it. On the
other hand, ogging well is an art, involving exactly when to uncloak, how
fast to go, etc. Two good oggers working together should be able to kill
the target every time. (Obviously this does not apply if the target is
an SB.) When ogging with someone else, it is important that you do not
both come from the same direction. If you do, your target can turn and
shoot at both of you at once. When I do it, I watch what direction my teammate
is coming in and decide which direction the target must run in to reach
his teammates, and attack him from that direction.

<p>Ogging a starbase: Enemy starbases can be very inconvenient. Killing
one requires a coordinated effort. Typically wave after wave of ships gang
up on the starbase and do suicide runs into it, firing everything they
have and then hopefully exploding right over it. However, its harder than
it sounds. Keys to a good ogg are:

<p>&nbsp;&middot;all oggers uncloak at once. If you do not, the base can
pick you off easily one at a time. Thus, if you know youre going to have
a head start on the other oggers using a heavy ship (BB/AS) is a good idea.
Conversely, dont take one if it will make your team wait for you.

<p>&nbsp;&middot;oggers come from different directions, for much the same
reason that ogging a normal ship from the same direction is inefficient.

<p>&nbsp;&middot;the ogg does not take place with a lot of the bases teammates
defending. One defender ~ two oggers, so minimize the defenders. Its not
enough to call an ogg when the base is alone, you also have to watch the
galactic to make sure that the enemy is not heading towards the base, otherwise
by the time your ogg gets there he could have several defenders.

<p>&nbsp;&middot;dont maxwarp directly at the base once you are on his
tactical! It is trivial for a good base to tell you are heading in a straight
line and pick you off with torps or phasers! If you head in at about warp
7 (in a CA) you will be able to dodge torps much more easily. It can also
be a good idea to fly at a point an inch or so to the side of the base
until you get close to him, to throw him off more.

<p>&nbsp;&middot;having an uncloaked CA/BB/AS lobbing torps (plinking)
at the base while the others are ogging can help a lot against a relatively
undefended base. With more defenders, it becomes much less effective. CRITICAL
to this is that you should NOT plink from the side of the base that the
oggers are coming in from. If you do, he can pressor off you to move away
from the oggers (and towards his team) much faster! Get behind the base,
and force him into your oggers! If, when you do this, the base tractors
you, you have two options. You can reverse direction, tractor him, fire,
and try to do as much damage as you can, finishing by exploding on him.
Or, you can slam on the maxwarp while firing torps at him. The latter is
more effective before an ogg, because the base will be forced to use more
wtemp phasering you and likely wtemp completely during the ogg. The former
option is only recommended if you are low on fuel or if youre youre really
close to the base when he starts firing.

<p>&nbsp;&middot;if the base has ships docked on it and does not pressor
them off, fire at them. Each docked ship that you blow up does an additional
100 points of damage to the base as well as preventing them from firing
at the other oggers.
