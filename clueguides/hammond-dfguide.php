<h3>
<a name="Dogfighting"></a>3.1 Dogfighting</h3>
Dogfighting is not the point of the game or even a primary objective.

<p>It is a means to an end for two reasons: a) you must have kills to carry
armies and take planets, and b) you often need to stop enemy ships from
doing things, such as taking your planets or bombing your space, or killing
your teams carrier (or you!) when you are trying to take a planet. Killing
them is one good way, although there are others.

<p>&nbsp;The following is from the Netrek archives by John Kirk Hammond
a.k.a.

<p>&nbsp;Lance.

<p>&nbsp;Here is the manual I mentioned. I posted it cause many people
said I should.

<p>&nbsp;I only use a CA, so if you play another ship take any advice with
a grain of salt (actually, take it all with a grain of salt.).

<p>&nbsp;There are, as I see it, 3 major things about successfully dogfighting.

<p>&nbsp;The most important, by far, is intensive use of tractors. The
second is to change speed constantly. The third is to det incoming torps.

<p>&nbsp;Remapping the keyboard in the .xtrekrc file is important. For
those interested, heres mine: keymap: dTeyadllrrqe D I think some of that
was redundant, but it works, so I dont care! :)

<p>I. Tractoring/pressoring

<p>&nbsp;II. Changing speeds

<p>&nbsp;III. Detting

<p>&nbsp;IV. Shields

<p>&nbsp;V. Torps

<p>&nbsp;VI. Phasers

<p>&nbsp;VII. Cloaking

<p>&nbsp;VIII. Plasma

<p>&nbsp;IX. Knowledge is half the battle :)

<p>&nbsp;I. Tractoring/pressoring

<p>&nbsp;

<p>A. Tractors are most useful for holding an opponent in place so that
your torps can catch up to him. By tractoring an opponent, one a) slows
the opponents turning speed down for a short time and b) pulls him in the
direction of your torps. THIS IS MOST IMPORTANT. I can not tell you how
many people have come rushing onto the screen that I have tractored, using
their speed, and pulled them right onto a string of torps.

<p>&nbsp;B. Tractors are also useful for pulling wounded enemies (and full-strength
scouts) into your phaser range so that you can finish them off. However,
see III. Detting for more on that.

<p>&nbsp;C. My favorite method of killing any enemy is to pull up next
to him, speed up to warp 8 or 9, and on the pass launch a volley of torps
and at the same time tractor him. Fire the torps almost perpendicular to
your ship, because at warp 8, they will move outward AND forward, hence
slamming into the opponents ship. I will also det his torps if they look
like they might hurt me. Sometimes, if the torps might not hit him, I pressor
him, and sometimes, just sometimes, his rapid turning pushes him BACK into
the string of torps.

<p>&nbsp;D. In the opposing situation, if an enemy tries this on me, I
turn in his direction and pressor off of him at the same time, which (most
of the time) propels me out of his incoming swath of torps. Pressors are
most useful for maneuvering into and out of positions for battle. I dont
use them extensively in battle but perhaps to keep a phaser-thirsty ship
out of range so that I can torp him, or, in cases where there is a good
BB playing, pressors are a key to survival.

<p>&nbsp;

<p>[JE: T/P can also be very useful to help you dodge torps. The

<p>&nbsp;most obvious way is to just turn away from your opponent

<p>&nbsp;and pressor off him to give you more room to dodge. If you

<p>&nbsp;have a teammate or an enemy off to one side that you can t/p

<p>&nbsp;off of to move you sideways out of the torps, that is even

<p>better. If youre using a teammate as a t/p post, though, make

<p>&nbsp;sure youre not moving him into torps at the same time!]

<p>&nbsp;II.Changing speeds

<p>&nbsp;

<p>A. It is important to change speeds constantly. Many opponents tend
to dodge torps I send at them. However, when involved in a dogfight, and
torps are flying in a perfect line at your ship, slam your hand down around
the 7-8-9 area, and watch as your CA accelerates past the torps (I dogfight
at 4). A while back, I fought with West 11 or 12 times on an abandoned
server. Against that kind of skill, I change speeds maybe, once very 3
or 4 seconds, just to throw him off as to where I am going. That match
ended in a tie or close to it. Those lil matches took over a minute usually.
Learn to be patient. The next entry, B, illustrates that.

<p>&nbsp;[JE: a style enormously helpful to conserving fuel while dogfighting
is to fight at a base speed of warp 2, tractoring, pressoring, and accelerating
as needed when torps are fired. This is most effective in a CA/BB/AS.

<p>&nbsp;Thanks to Erik Lauer for pointing this out.]

<p>&nbsp;B. The other day, I angered an opposing BB so much that he roared
onto the screen firing a plasma and a blob of torps. I calmly turned perpendicular
to his plasma and accelerated. That got me out of the torpsway and out
of the possible turning radius of the plasma. The BB then turned tail and
slowly moved away from me, firing torps all the way. By moving back and
forth and calmly accelerating out of his torps I followed him all the way
up to a fuel planet, never raising my shields or firing a shot. He started
orbiting the fuel planet, and I sped up to 8 or 9 and roared by him, firing
a volley of torps, tractoring him off the planet, detting, and phasering.
Needless to say, he died and I lost my shields. But I was patient.

<p>&nbsp;C. Also, remember to pressor oggers that appear behind you, as
this will keep them from blowing up on you (I tend to tractor them, fire
torps at them, and then pressor them, thus ensuring their death and preserving
most of mine). However, you must be going away from the ogger at at least
warp 7 for this to work, because pressors only really neutralize the oggers
tractor.

<p>&nbsp;D. When you are attempting to catch up to a target, and he is
fleeing at similar speed, you can do 2 things: 1) If there are enemies
in the area who could help him, you must get him quickly, so det torps
sent in your direction. 2) If you and he are alone, if he fires a line
at you, slam the 1-5 warp area and turn a little to the side. This usually
lets you dodge most of them, but he gets those few extra seconds to flee
a little more. However, if he has no help in the area, you might still
have a chance of catching him.

<p>&nbsp;

<p>III. Detting.

<p>&nbsp;

<p>Here is the Netrek concept that will get me in trouble with other good
dogfighters. Most never det in battle. I, however, live on detting. I will
cover detting on the accepted scalefrom A to C.

<p>&nbsp;A.Det when tractoring scouts in and phaser them to death. Scouts
fire dinky 25 pt torps that do 6 pts of damage when you det them. If you
can tractor them and you are moving at sufficient speed, you can crunch
a scout in a CA. As long as you det. This goes for any wounded ship, too.
If a CA is wounded and is sitting stopped, rush at an angle, fire torps
and tractor him in. However, you MUST remember to det torps. If you dont
10 to 1 you will mutual with him.

<p>&nbsp;B.Det torps for wounded ships, planet takers, and SBs. If you
want to be a good escort, stay AHEAD of the planet taker and det any torps
headed for the planet. However, REMEMBER to fire at incoming oggers, and
if you must, mutual with any too close to the planet.

<p>&nbsp;C.Det enemy torps to wound other enemies. This I use only in special
situations. When a cloaker (planet taker) flies over enemy torps, det them.
You will take damage, but so will he. Any planet taker that slows down
cause of wounds is usually dead in any clueful game. Planet taking counts
on the taker to make it to the planet as fast as possible before oggers
overwhelm the escorts.

<p>&nbsp;D.OK, I also det a lot in combat. When I am dodging, I will often
det to open a holein a stream of torps, or det the first few torps in a
string so that I can zoom by. Remember, detting ideally only inflicts 25%
of the damage on your ship, so detting 4 or 5 torps really is nothing in
a CA. I also tend to det whenever I make a pass at an enemy. Granted, at
one inch away those torps might not hit me, but I dont take the chance.
50-130 pts norm on a dogfight, I guess. At one inch, one pass is usually
enough :). Some good players can use my detting against me, but not always.

<p>&nbsp;E.You know those situations where you and an opponent suddenly
zoom on the screen at the same time and right at each other? Usually, you
will ram each other with a blob of torps. However, the best way to survive
is to slam your hand down on the speed of 1-4, turn rapidly to one side,
fire torps, pressor, and DET constantly. About 50% of the time this will
allow me to destroy the incoming ship, but I in turn usually take almost
80-90% damage. However, I survive.

<p>&nbsp;[JE: maxwarping at an enemy is never a good idea, and if you

<p>do find yourself in that situation, keep in mind that it may be

<p>better to mutual than to go to 90% damage and spend a lot of

<p>&nbsp;time repairingif you mutual, you immediately get a new ship.]

<p>&nbsp;F.If you are in a situation where both you and your opponent are
both wounded and he is taking pot shots at your ship, go into repair mode.
When he fires a torp, and you cant dodge it, det it. Repair mode will usually
repair enough shields for a 10 pt det. This way you conserve your fuel.
Once you get enough fuel, start moving and unleash a full string of torps
at the enemy.

<p>&nbsp;G.If you are in a situation when you have enough fuel to kill
a crippled ship but he is right on top of you and his explosion will kill
you, pressor him away before phasering him and killing him (assuming he
has no fuel).

<p>&nbsp;

<p>IV. Shields

<p>&nbsp;

<p>Never keep your shields up all the time. Your hull doesnt repair and
your fuel regenerates slower. Get in the habit of putting shields up ONLY
when you are doing the following:

<p>&nbsp;Approaching an enemy planet for bombing or planet taking.

<p>&nbsp;Within about &frac34; the phaser distance of a CA or -->BB &lt;--.

<p>&nbsp;If torps are going to hit you.

<p>&nbsp;If a cloaker is coming to ogg you and he is within phaser distance
on the galactic.

<p>&nbsp;If friends fire a lot of torps over you and an enemy is in the
vicinity to det them on you.

<p>&nbsp;Its fun to let a SC to get within phaser range: let him lock you
a few times and he (sometimes) get cocky. Once he turns around to engage
you, tractor him in and kill him.

<p>&nbsp;

<p>V. Torps

<p>&nbsp;

<p>A. Though I covered most of this in tractor, PRACTICE, PRACTICE,

<p>&nbsp;PRACTICE. Some people here at Duke who program borgs say my torps
are almost perfect anyway. I have been accused many times of having a blessed
borg.It is because I practiced lots last year (this year I dont play very
much anymore). PRACTICE AIMING THOSE TORPS. Learn to lead your opponent.

<p>&nbsp;B. Dont det your own torps when you are first learning. This is
the lazy mans way of getting another shot. When you are first learning,
and you die cause your first shot missed, you will soon learn to start
aiming better. If, however, you keep detting your torps, you will waste
all your fuel in no time and gain little experience from the situation.

<p>&nbsp;

<p>VI. Phasers

<p>&nbsp;

<p>A. I use phasers when I make a pass at an enemy. Usually it is the difference
that kills him. It is difficult to remember to tractor, torp 8 times, shields
up, det, phaser, and move...but the extra 40 pt phaser sometimes is all
you can get on the guy.

<p>&nbsp;B. I dont suggest attempting to whittle down an enemy with phasers.
The only person Ive ever known to do this effectively against me was Val,
and hes gone...

<p>&nbsp;[JE: youd be surprised how quickly a man who uses both

<p>&nbsp;phasers and torps well can take down someone who only

<p>&nbsp;torps. Learn where your 20 point phaser range is, and

<p>phaser any time he is within that range. If you are doing

<p>&nbsp;less than 20 points you are probably wasting fuel.]

<p>&nbsp;VII. Cloaking

<p>&nbsp;

<p>A. Dont cloak (remember, this is a dogfighters manual).

<p>&nbsp;B. Cloaking is only for dodging outgoing oggers(those coming to
ogg you before you reach your target) or to pass over some interference
dogfighters who are between you and your target.

<p>&nbsp;C. Cloaking is for mainly planet takers and oggers. That is NOT
my forte.

<p>&nbsp;

<p>VIII. Plasma

<p>&nbsp;

<p>A. Never use plasma.

<p>&nbsp;B. However, plasma is useful when there is a solitary planet taker
orbiting a planet and you are racing to it. A plasma and a blob of 8 torps
will usually do the trick.

<p>&nbsp;C. S M A C K !

<p>&nbsp;

<p>IX. Knowledge is half the battle.:)

<p>&nbsp;

<p>A. KNOW YOUR ENEMY. Know what kinds of ships the bitmaps are.

<p>&nbsp;Learn what kind of shields and hull and torps and phasers each
ship has. Learn to add up quickly in your head, Well, 3 torps and a decent
phaser. 120 for the torps, 40 for the phaser. That CA is hurting and wont
be able to flee from me for a bit...

<p>&nbsp;B. Keep track of your shields and your fuel. Make sure you have
enough fuel to get out of there, cause you might get 2 kills, but an ogger
will rip you to shreds when you have an empty tank.

<p>&nbsp;C. Learn to cripple an enemy. When you are rushing to say ogg
a SB hanging around the enemy home planet or especially to take the home
planet, NEVER kill oggers coming to engage the blob of escorts and planet
takers you are moving with. If you do so, you a) waste your own fuel and
shields and momentum, and b) enable the enemy to reappear right next to
your target with full everything. Bad move. Either cloak before you get
to outgoing oggers, or hit them with 4 torps to cripple them &lt;-- This
is possible.
