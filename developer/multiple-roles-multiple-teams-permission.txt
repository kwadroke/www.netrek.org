Hi,

I hope I've contacted the correct Tedd Hadley and Marcus Huber, who loooong ago
wrote the paper:

"Multiple Roles, Multiple Teams, Dynamic Environment: Autonomous Netrek Agents,"
Proceedings of the First International Conference on Autonomous Agents (AA),
Marina del Rey, CA, February 1997, pgs 332-339.

I am the current maintainer of the Netrek Homepage (www.netrek.org), currently
in the process of a long due update of those webpages. Yes, it means Netrek is
still alive! ;-) Since recently someone had the bright idea of advertising
Netrek on download.com and several other download sites, we are seeing a nice
influx of new players again!

Now my request: on http://www.netrek.org/developer.html we mention your paper.
It would be nice if we could actually provide it directly. Actually I could
link already directly to CiteSeer: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/27115.html,
but I would like to get permission from the authors first.

Can I put up a copy of the paper for the netrek community?

Regards,
Erik Hietbrink

Hi Erik,

Boy, it's been a LONG time since I did any Netrek "domain knowledge
acquisition". :) Sure, feel free to offer the paper directly from the
Netrek.org site. That might violate a copyright with whichever publisher
holds that paper but nobody will complain.

Glad to hear Netrek's still going strong. I went to play a while back
but my old .netrekrc file busted the client I downloaded and I never got
around to modifying it.
