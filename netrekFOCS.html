Archive-Name: games/netrek/suggestions/part1<br>
Last-Updated: 16 Mar 1997<br>
Changes: Converted to HTML, made significant updates to a number of questions,
	 added question about a shared player database.<p>


<i>Note: This was written by Andy McFadden but is now being maintained by me
along with the other FAQ lists.  Many thanks to Andy for compiling it
(in addition to his other contributions to the netrek world).</i>
<p>

The same ideas get proposed over and over by people trying to enhance the
game, and the same discussions come up again and again.  This file is an
attempt to stem the flow by presenting old discussions and arguments
against the ideas.
<p>

This assumes you are familiar with the game itself and some of the
vocabulary (argot) involved (e.g. scum, ogg, LPS, Iggy).  This is NOT
intended to be a capsule summary of rec.games.netrek discussions; it is
intended to help people trying to enhance the game understand why many of
the obvious improvements won't work or won't be accepted by the Netrek
community.  As such, it contains one-sided and occasionally opinionated
material.  I welcome improvements and stronger arguments, but if you want
to debate the value of something I will probably ignore you.
<p>

[ This file has been evolving since September of 1992.  Some of the info
may have become outdated as Netrek evolved. ]
<p>

REMEMBER: Netrek is not Star Trek.  Netrek is not reality.  Star Trek is
not reality.  Netrek is not Nintendo.  DO NOT suggest modifications purely
to make the game "more realistic".  ONLY consider ideas that will improve
game play.

<a name="1"><h4>
1. How about team DI?
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
Too many rank scums out there for themselves.  Need to add an incentive for
team play, so that they will get more DI if their team does better.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Change the DI structure so that you get points for stuff your teammates do.
Alternatively, change it so that you get points for different "team stuff",
like taking strategically placed planets or killing carriers.
<p>

<strong>Why not:</strong><br>
Most "team DI" schemes will cause people to switch to the team that's
winning, because that's where the points are.  It is possible right now to
see the players on each team before making the initial team selection; this
would make unfair teams the rule.
<p>

Changing the individual values of things is difficult when you consider how
the current DI scheme works.  "DI" is simply the sum of offense, bombing,
and planet ranks, multiplied by the number of hours you have been playing,
and then adjusted according to the global average.  There are no fixed DI
values for doing certain things; just your relationship to the rest of the
people on the server.
<p>

If you try to reward players on teams that are doing well, people will
quit when their team starts to lose, creating a steamroll effect (all
the clued people join the winning side, all the non-clues stay on the
losing side).  Keeping track of planets won/lost during a game is a nice
idea, but will lead to a lot of quit-scumming when the other team is
taking a planet or two.  Rank scums will always be scums; you can change
the rules but they will always find annoying ways of working around them.
<p>

Killing people with armies gives you (5*armies) bombing credit, and taking
core planets is worth more than other planets, so the incentives exist;
people are simply unaware of them or feel it is easier to do things the
scum way.
<p>

Incidentally, DI works like this:
<p>

<li>There are three factors: bombing (the number of armies you have,
bombed), offense (the number of enemies you have killed), and
planets (the number of planets you have taken).  There's also defense
(number of times you have been killed), but most servers have done
away with the defense criteria since ogging became popular.
<p>

<li>The server takes these values, considers how long it took you to
get them, and then compares that against the server average.  From
this you get "ratings", where having a 1.0 bombing rating means you
bomb as many armies per unit time as the average player, 2.0 ratings
mean you bomb twice as many, and so on.
<p>

<li>The bombing, planet, and offense ratings are added.  This gives your
total ratings.  An average player would have 3.0 ratings.
<p>

<li>The ratings are multiplied by the number of hours you have spent in
t-mode on that server.  This is your DI.
<p>

Hitting 'U' (shift-u) while playing brings up a chart showing what ratings
and how many hours you need to make a particular rank.  You can also promote
if you don't have the ratings but have twice the DI, or if you're ratings
are two points down and you have four times the DI.  You can't be demoted.
<p>

Many players are under the misconception that you "get DI" for doing a
particular action.  You don't.
<p>

<hr>
<a name="2"><h4>
2. How about no DI at all?
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
DI is a mistake.  It is the reason for scumming.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Toss it.  At least toss all the ranks above Captain.
<p>

<strong>Why not:</strong><br>
Many people like to advance in rank.  DI was developed because the original
Xtrek had nothing but win/loss stats, so ratio scumming was the only way to
look impressive (you think DI is bad... heh).  There are a large number of
Admirals who like having their rank (hey, it took them a long time to get
there), and some of them run servers.  DI is like the USA's electoral voting
system: it's not great, and the country might be better without it, but it's
not going away without a major fight.
<p>

Besides which, it's a good way to attract [scum] players to new servers.
<p>

Any change to DI is simply going to shift scumming one way or the other.
Most arcade games are centered around the accumulation of points; the object
is to do certain things, for which you rewarded.  The idea of Netrek, however,
is to win the game; rank should be just an incidental feature.  However,
there will always be those who see the accumulation of points, rank, or
whatever as the driving goal.
<p>

The Holy Grail of DI changing is a system that rewards only non-scum
activities.  However, telling scumming from teamwork requires human
intervention or artificial intelligence in most cases.
<p>

<strong>Jean-Marc Tanzi writes:</strong><br>
>I believe that any team game, like netrek, where a machine could
>really compute how well you play cannot be that good.
<p>

<strong>Other interesting ideas:</strong><br>
<li>Have players promote each other.  Once you get to a certain rank, you can
promote those beneath you.  This has a chicken & egg problem which can be
solved by importing a database or with some active administration at first.
Note this is open to abuses (demoting people you don't like, promoting
really lame players to embarass them, etc), and tends to trivialize rank.
Tried on b62150.student.cwru.edu, never widely accepted.
<p>

<li>Shift planet credit so that you get partial credit for making it neutral
and partial credit for taking it.  This is accomplished by (for example)
multiplying everybody's planet rating by 3 and then awarding 1 for neuting
and 2 for taking.  Since the global average is also multiplied by 3,
player ratings don't change, so DI is constant.  Tried on
bigbang.astro.indiana.edu (now lexus).  Doesn't seem to significantly
change the game.
<p>

<hr>
<a name="3"><h4>
3. All ships shouldn't fire 8 torps.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
The game is unbalanced.  SBs should be able to shoot more torps than others.
Maybe SCs shouldn't be able to shoot as many.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Increase SB torps to 12, or scale all others accordingly.
<p>

<strong>Why not:</strong><br>
Going to 12 torps requires mods to both client and server.  This will increase
CPU time slightly, and will increase network usage.  You can't just switch
on the ship type, either, because a SB could fire 12 torps and then refit.
<p>

Scaling all ships down (so that an SC would fire, say, three torps total)
has been tried on Sturgeon; see <a href="#A1">appendix A1.</a>
<p>

Any change to the ship characteristics is going to be met with a great deal
of resistance.  The game is very carefully balanced, and any changes can
result in drastic changes in the way it's played.
<p>

<hr>
<a name="4"><h4>
4. Let's make cloakers blind.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
Cloaking is too powerful.  Ogging is getting out of hand.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Remove certain items from the tac display of a cloaked ship, like enemy
ships, planets, torps, etc.
<p>

<strong>Why not:</strong><br>
Been done.  Not very popular.  Removing planets makes them hard to take
(you just sit there watching your 'O' flag, hoping that nobody will kill
you because they KNOW you are coming straight in).  Removing torps is bad
for the same reason.
<p>

Removing other players to make ogging harder is bad because most players
LIKE ogging.  It's fun, and it's part of the game. 
<p>

It turns out that this is a good example of why not to change the rules of
the game.  As people have gotten better at phaserlocking and being aware
of the galactic, ogging has become very difficult; where it used to 
dominate strategy, now most top teams actively avoid cloaking in most
situations.  
<p>

<hr>
<a name="5"><h4>
5. Let's allow cloakers to fire.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
Now that Star Trek VI is out, cloakers (esp. Kli) should be able to fire.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Allow ships to fire when cloaked, possibly with a higher fuel or wtemp cost.
<p>

<strong>Why not:</strong><br>
Gimme a break.  Ogging would become trivial without changes to other parts
of the game.  See the Sturgeon changes in <a href="#A1">Appendix A1.</a>
<p>

<hr>
<a name="6"><h4>
6. The DD needs to be improved.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
The DD is weak.  It can't take bomb as well as an SC, and it can't fight as
well as CA.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Give the DD bigger shields, or bigger torps (30 is too small), or more
powerful phasers, and perhaps a bigger fuel tank.
<p>

<strong>Why not:</strong><br>
As Tom Holub put it (paraphrased), "The CA is weak.  It can't bomb as well
as a DD, and it can't fight as well as a BB."  All ships have their place,
it's just a question of finding the right niche.  DDs can carry 5 armies,
making them more of a threat to planets than the SC.
<p>

Several discussions have raged over rec.games.netrek about what the One True
Use of the DD is.  None have been found.  They can't be used as a big SC
nor as a small CA; they require a different perspective.  I won't offer
them here, but will instead relegate it to the thrice-revised DD Players Guide.
<p>

As a side note, the cooling rate on DDs was changed from 6 to 7, allowing
them to go great distances without overheating.  Many players who previously
thought the DD fully worthless now consider it to be valuable in certain
circumstances.  This is another example of changes in play styles affecting
perception of the game; DD cooling was originally changed from 7 to 6
because DD's were considered too powerful.
<p>

<strong>Newer, alternative proposals:</strong><br>
<li>make the CA weaker, by reducing phaser strength or manuverability (but
then the SC gets correspondingly stronger) [implemented on bigbang]
<p>

<li>have a reentry delay based on ship size (again, the SC gets stronger, plus
no one wants to spend time looking at the entry screen.
<p>

<li>give the DD mondo plasmas, making it a special-purpose ship
<p>

<li>remove the DD entirely so people stop whining
<p>

I (the pronoun "I" is somewhat ambugious in this document, as I, Tom Holub,
have not removed all of Andy McFadden's "I"s) am personally of the opinion
that there isn't space for a full-time ship in between the current CA and
the current SC--any ship between the two will be either useful only in 
spots, or will be powerful enough to make one of the others obsolete.  I
don't think this is a bad thing. 
<p>

<hr>
<a name="7"><h4>
7. Here's a neat idea for a new ship.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
There's a gap in Netrek that really needs to be filled.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
I want a new ship X that can do Y and Z.
<p>

<strong>Why not:</strong><br>
KSU-Galaxy/Chaos servers are a prime example of ship design run amok.  The
GA had huge torps, fast phasers, an incredible refueling rate, and eventually
they even boosted the manuverability on some servers.  As a result, nobody
played anything but GA (there were some DD holdouts, but once you could turn
in GA at a reasonable warp most of those switched over).
<p>

You may think your new design will fit perfectly into Netrek.  You're
probably wrong.  Some examples from the past:
<p>

<li>mini-starbase.  Like your normal SB, but less filling.  You'd get a couple
on a team, or maybe just have them more often.  Two of these together,
pressoring each other out of danger, would be damn near invincible when
guarding a repair planet.  It's basically a Super Planet Defender, like
a BB on steroids, and it really wouldn't add anything new to the game,
since it's easier to ogg than an SB and slower than a BB.
<p>

<li>fighters.  SBs would launch these, perhaps they'd be robot-controlled.
Again, neat idea, but so what?  They would either have to occupy a player
slot (reducing the number of other robots you can have) or require
modifications to both client and server (which is a Bad Thing).  Again,
what do they add?  Are they any different from plasma torps with a high
tracking setting?  See the <a href="#A1">Sturgeon changes</a>, which 
implemented them as slow-moving tracking torps, which SBs could fire instead 
of normal torps.
<p>

<li>floating fuel platform.  Another pseudo-SB, which looks like an AS but
has fuel like an SB.  Easy ogg target; what good is it if you have to keep
it sitting behind your home planet?  One BB can off the thing, so it's
not even valuable as a distraction.
<p>

<li>ogger ship.  Maybe it uncloaks fast (a la the old Calvin scheme), or it
does 200 points of damage when it explodes, or it has small torps but a
big phaser, or whatever.  Anybody who thinks they need this has never been
ogged by somebody in a CA who knows what they're doing.  This would just
make Ogging by Idiots that much easier.
<p>

<li>super scout ship.  Strip off most offensive weaponry, make it real fast.
What's the point?  Try stopping a good SC player, and THEN see if you
really want to propose this.
<p>

<li>big fat starbase.  This one has the actual size increased, making it easier
to hit, but is given better shields to compensate.  So what's the point...?
It would involve changing a lot of code in the server and client to special
case the various options, plus new bitmaps (for shield/cloak as well),
etc, etc.
<p>

Many suggestions like these come from people trying to compensate for
inadequacies in the ships (sounds vaguely Freudian, doesn't it?)  It takes
time and a lot of practice to become a really effective player; even
the lowly SC can be a marvelous dogfighting ship when it's flown by a
skilled player (with no lag).
<p>

The "paradise" server introduced a number of new ships, but it also changed
a LOT of other game features, and required a new client to play.  One was
the "jump ship", which could carry 4 players and go warp 30, but had only
25 shields and 25 damage.  (Paradise continues to be refined, so I'm not
going to try and describe their setup.)
<p>

<hr>
<a name="8"><h4>
8. How about a ship design system?
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
Other games (e.g. xtank) allow you to change the way your ship is set up.  I
want to be able to adjust my ship characteristics according to the way I play.

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Allow ship characteristics to be adjusted by the player.

<strong>Why not:</strong><br>
This was implemented in a version of the original Xtrek game.  The tendency
was to do things like strip all torpedos, most of the hull, half of the
engines, and all of the cloaking ability from the ship and get phasers that
could do 40 points of damage to ships outside of visual range (but had to
be orbiting a fuel planet to fire more than twice).
<p>

Games quickly became ridiculous.  Either your planets were being taken by
someone completely invisible, or you were getting destroyed by ships you
couldn't see.  Nobody bothered dodging, because nobody fired torps.  
Basically, this winds up removing strategic aspects from the game in
favor of tactical aspects, and that's not a good thing.
<p>

Any implementation will require carefully balanced limits and a lot of play
time before it would become widespread.  Anyone who wishes to try this will
likely have to set up their own server and then try very hard to attract
players to it.
<p>

As a side note, <a href="#A1">Sturgeon</a> has a feature somewhat like this: 
predefined ship upgrades after you get kills.  Unfortunately this can (and 
does) encourage ratio scumming and runner scumming, because nobody with a nice
big fat ship wants to die.  (It also introduced "upgrade scumming" to the 
world: repeatedly killing a second login to get lots of upgrades.)
<p>

<hr>
<a name="9"><h4>
9. Remove the kill restriction on army carrying.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
Imposing a restriction based on kills is unrealistic and silly.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Allow any player to carry armies.
<p>

<strong>Why not:</strong><br>
If you allow this, you remove a big part of the challenge of the game.
Getting a kill and staying alive while trying to move armies around is
one of primary challenges in Netrek.  If anybody can carry armies, then
every player is a potential planet taker, and it's impossible to focus
the defense of your space.
<p>

You will also increase the instances of Ensign Fubar scampering about,
picking up armies and dying with them.  This is a Very Bad Thing when your
team is low on armies.  If a player can't get a kill, he probably doesn't
have the skill or experience to take a planet without getting nailed.
<p>

(People who need practice taking planets need to practice staying alive first!)
<p>

For those who insist on reality, it can be argued that Star Fleet Command
doesn't like to entrust armies with commanders who haven't proven themselves
in battle (especially Kli!)  It has also been suggested that the captains
use the hull fragments of the enemy starships to build crew accommodations
for the armies.
<p>

<hr>
<a name="10"><h4>
10. Remove the kill restriction on plasma torps.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
Requiring kills for plasmas is silly.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Allow plasmas for one and all.
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
While this is a trivial server change (quick alteration to .sysdef), it's
there for a reason, namely that having 8 battleships with plasma torps makes
taking planets impossible.  LPSs would never end.  Chaos servers allowed
infinite plasmas, and plasma-wars became rather common.  So did plasma-
muggings (you can't shoot three incoming plasmas!)  The ping-pong plasmas
made life interesting, but then there's not much point in taking planets
on a Chaos server anyway.
<p>

The way things are now, players with 2+ kills can be ogged, which prevents
them from firing more plasmas.
<p>

While it's true that the rich become richer (or perhaps the deadly become
more deadly), there's nothing wrong with elitism in Netrek.  It's just a
game.  Deal with it.
<p>

<hr>
<a name="11"><h4>
11. Get rid of LPSs.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
LPSs suck.  They're boring and they make my stats hurt.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Various ideas.  A small sampling:
<li>have a 5 second delay before players can reenter
<li>have a delay inversely proportional to the number of planets your team has
<li>enter moving away at maxwarp
<li>have the presence of enemy ships force new ships to appear farther away
(a la Plato Empire)
<li>enter without fuel (this is also used as an anti-psycho-ogging "fix")
<li>use the random entry planet selection stuff, extended to work on planets
that the team doesn't own
<li>allow a certain number of construction points per minute; big ships use
more construction points; once exceeded, you have to wait for it to climb
back up
<li>genocide happens when only one planet remains
<li>allow a ship with 5 or 10 kills to carry a MondoBomb; when it reaches the
planet it obliterates it
<li>turn an SC with 3 kills into Super Ogger, doing several hundred points of
damage with its explosion
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
The Last Planet Stand is one of the few things in Netrek that absolutely
REQUIRES teamwork.  It is nearly impossible to break an LPS unless the
attackers are organized or the defenders are largely clueless.
<p>

A reasonable solution to the Indefinite LPS (one that drags on and on
because all the clued players on the attacking side bailed) is the Bronco
LPS timer.  The attackers get 30 minutes to break it, at which point the
galaxy resets.  There are players who dislike the timer because it encourages
the attackers to slack off ("oh, we'll just wait for the timer, we'll never
break through), but it's proven to be a reasonable compromise, although it
has definitely reduced the average LPS-breaking ability.
<p>

LPSs are here to stay.  It is possible to come back from one, just as it is
possible to genocide a race.  If you are concerned about the damage to your
stats, then set up your own server, scum your way to admiral, and get on
with your life.
<p>

Side note: LPSs with homeworld agris are monumentally unpopular.  You can
hold off against a fleet with greater numbers without too much difficulty.
Most servers explicitly prevent the home world from being agri; if your
favorite server doesn't, tell the server admin.  (The other side of the
coin is that, once taken, it's harder for the home team to retake.  I don't
think this balances the pain of taking it in the first place, however.)
<p>

<hr>
<a name="12"><h4>
12. Get rid of Iggy!
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
Iggy is nothing but a pain.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Lose him.
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
Iggy is a Bronco server feature that adds a bit more randomness to the game;
it's a robot that comes in at intervals and chases the nearest ship.  The
only reason it ever made it into the normal server distribution is that
the server god of bronco, Terence Chang, invented it, and the CMU weenies
thought of it as their own.  Gladly, Iggy has now been removed from all major
servers; robots come in only when players do stuff like take planets out
of t-mode.

<hr>
<a name="13"><h4>
13. Combine all of the server processes into one.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
My workstation can't handle all the context switches.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Merge all the ntserv processes into one, and maybe even combine them with
daemonII, so instead of the Server Union we'd have the Unified Process.
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
A few people have tried this.  There are advantages and disadvantages to
doing this, not the least of which is that it requires a complete rewrite of
the server, a partial to full rewrite of the client, and will work best as a
strictly UDP implementation (which requires a whole new protocol).
<p>

Among the disadvantages are the possible loss of the shared memory segment
(which kills the traditional tool interface), the need to bring the server
down whenever changes are made, the inability to simply restart failed
components (ex: restartable daemon), changes in CPU load possibly resulting
in lower UNIX process priorities (and thus worse real-time performance),
changes in the way the kernel sees Netrek (e.g. waiting for I/O), poorer
performance on MP machines, the larger executable will be more likely to be
swapped out under BSD, loss of memory firewalls between components,
possibility of security breaches in a UDP-only setup, etc, etc.
<p>

There are a number of advantages, but this file is meant to discourage you,
not entice you.  A reading of the process scheduling chapter in _The Design
and Implementation of 4.3BSD UNIX_ should be required for anyone contemplating
this.  It turns out to not be a big deal, anyway; all modern machines can 
handle a full netrek server.
<p>

Here's a note from somebody who once tried it:

Ok, not to beat a dead dog, but I've been working on this for a while now.
It was pretty easy to come up with multiplexed I/O for logging in.  HOWEVER,
the big problems are:

14. Put the number of armies next to the planet.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
It's annoying to have to hit 'i' all the time to get army counts.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Put the number of armies on each planet next to the planet's bitmap on the
galactic map.
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
This is the first step down the path to "Netrek for Morons(tm)".  You can see
when a planet pops by watching the galactic map; having ever-increasing army
counts staring you in the face is like having a compass attached to your
nose.
<p>

It's true that the information is accessible, if somewhat inconvenient.
However, players who aren't paying attention won't see the new army
numbers, and are less likely to react to an army bitmap on the display than
they are to seeing "15" next to Sir.  If you aren't paying attention to
armies, you lose.  There are several places in Netrek where this is the
case.
<p>

Netrek rewards vigilance and a keen eye as well as intelligence and fast
reflexes.  Being constantly aware of everything around you is a challenge
beyond the goals of the game itself; it requires the player to improve
himself, and rewards experience.  Doing all but say, "do this next" will
make things too simple, and reduce the sense of accomplishment acquired
from mastery of the game.  Knowing exactly where the armies are and how many
requires as much skill as holding a phaser lock, which is as it should be.
<p>

There are those who think otherwise.  I'm not presenting their opinions here,
because if you are about to propose this then you share those opinions
already.  Suffice it to say that there is enough disagreement to keep this
from becoming a standard feature of Netrek.

This is yet another stepping stone on the path to ButtHeadTrek.  This would

You don't even have to pay attention to the game to know what you should do

While this is in the same vein as the army counts, it isn't really

16. Prevent bombing/taking out of T-mode.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
Many players either don't know Netrek-etiquette about not messing with
planets outside of T-mode, or they choose to ignore it.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Make the server enforce it.
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
The main problem with it is that sometimes its okay to bomb out of t-mode.
If you've got a 2-on-2 "training" session and just want to practice trading
planets, it's annoying to have it blocked.  Making this policy work without
getting in the way generally requires human intervention.  Most servers 
nowadays do something to prevent you from doing this, but, for example,
on servers where you can't take neutral planets out of t-mode, you can
genocide a team (leaving their last planet neutral), and then they quit
out, you lose T-mode, and you can't reset the galaxy because you can't take
neutral planets.  
<p>
The most common implementation now is to not allow bombing, but to allow
dropping armies out of t-mode.  This gets around the problem resetting the
galaxy.  Most server send in robots to kill people who do this, which 
should keep people from doing it too much.

17. Just have a two-race galaxy.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
Netrek is a descendant of Empire, which had four warring races.  However,
Netrek games typically have only two races fighting each other, so the rest
of the planets are just worthless junk.  This increases network/CPU overhead,
and leads to 3rd-race scumming.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Remove two of the races.  Leave Fed/Rom, or Rom/Kli (with a reorg of KLI
space).
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
The other planets serve a variety of uses.  They can be used by scout bombers
and planet takers for refueling and repair, and allow cloaking near hostile
space.  It also allows 3rd-space scumming, but that's a different issue.
<p>

Most importantly, the size of the galaxy increases the area which needs
to be defended.  If you reduce the galaxy to a two-way, it will be impossible
to attack from or retreat to neutral space.  All offensive actions will take
place in a single corridor, making starbases and large ships much more
important.  Bombing and deep planet taking will become more difficult
because there is a single path of attack.
<p>

Whether you think this is a good idea or not, there's no denying that it
will dramatically change game strategies.  It is unlikely that such a
proposal will be popular.
<p>

<hr>
<a name="18"><h4>
18. Add incentives for scout bombing.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
Very few people are willing to SC-bomb because of the drain on stats (too
much time away from taking planets).  Bombing 2 or 3 armies at a time doesn't
really help the bombing stats much; ogging carriers may do more.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Change the amount of bombing credit based on the number of armies sitting
on the planet when bombing began.  So you'd get massive credit for bombing
the last three armies, but not nearly as much for bombing it from 60 to 55.
<p>

<strong>Alternate proposal:</strong><br>
Start all planets out at 5 or 6 armies.
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
Both proposals suffer from the fact that average bombing stats have already
been computed on most servers based on the "one army, one vote" scheme
with 30 initial armies on each planet.  Changing the setup mid-stream would
make it nearly impossible to get a 1.0 bombing rating.
<p>

It's also highly unlikely that anybody really concerned about rank is going
to do much scout bombing anyway.  Advancing bombing at the expense of
offense and planets is not a good way to scum up to Admiral.
<p>

The alternate proposal also affects the ability of a starbase to fill up
with 25 armies at the start of a game.  Overall, the second proposal will
likely have a dramatic impact on the way the first few minutes of a game
are played - something that isn't likely to go over too well with the "old
timers."
<p>

The INL server, and some pickup servers, have gone to 17-army game starts; 
this helps some, but not enough.  It does allow the base to get 25 armies
fairly easily, however.
<p>

lexus.astro.indiana.edu has also implemented "flatten credit"; you get extra
bombing credit for bombing all the armies off a planet, no matter how many
started there.  That way, bombing a planet from 5 to 4 (which SC bombers do
all the time) is worth more than bombing it from 17 to 16.  It still
doesn't make bombing a high-DI activity.

Depending on the implementation, you might be able to just hit ^Z and
suspend your process.  When the client host's buffers fill up it'll look
just like a network storm to the server host.  If all you want to handle

20. Change the names of the races or the planets.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
Feds never fight Klingons, and who are these Orions, anyway?  The names
are outdated and don't reflect Trek stuff.
<p>

<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Use Ferengi, Cardassians, or some other "real life" hostile races.  Change
the names of some of the planets to reflect Star Trek stuff, i.e. use
names like "Farpoint" and "Vulcan".
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
The names of the races and the planets are ingrained into Netrek players.
If somebody says "clear org", experienced players know where to go without
even looking at the map.
<p>

Races are the same way.  Everyone who has played for a while is used to Rom
being top left, Orion being lower right, etc.  People don't write, "K3 is
scumming in lower-left space".  It's Fed space, and it always should be.
Sure, people would get used to it after a while, but I don't think most
people WANT to get used to it.  In a few situations it can be a real pain,
such as when the first letter changes.  If you want to send a message to the
other team, you have to use a different key.  It's also used in a lot of
places in the code, so it'd be a pain to change (and if you didn't change
the code, but rather just the external appearance, it'd be very confusing
for people prying into the source code).
<p>

Remember what this document says up top: Netrek is not Star Trek, Netrek is
not Real Life.  It's a game, with names chosen as convenient points of
reference.  If you want to set up a server with California city names or
campus buildings instead of star systems, feel free.  This has been done,

21. Add ship collisions.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
It would be neat to have ships collide.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Have ships either damage each other on collision or bounce off in some
elastic manner.
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
Bouncing ships would be, well, weird.  Crunching ships in a BB by rolling
over them would be amusing, but probably wouldn't add much to the game.
<p>

However, there are more serious considerations.  First, consider what happens
if you are cloaked ogging somebody, and collisions do damage.  Now you don't
even need to uncloak to kill the other guy; just run into him.  Makes
avoiding oggs nearly impossible, especially since you can't pressor the
attacker away.
<p>

Second, suppose you are cloaked taking a planet.  As it is the defenders have
to locate you and hit you with enough torps/phaser hits to blow you up.
Escorts can det torps to keep their takers safe.  Collisions make it far
easier to defend planets: whether the collisions bounce or do damage, planet
defenders can simply cloak and fly over the planet and have a good chance of
destroying you or at least knocking you off.  They don't even have to uncloak
anymore, making it harder for the escorts to do something useful.  And if
collisions bounce, you can just knock the escorts into the planet takers.
Heck, if you want to defend a planet, just sit right in the middle, and
nobody else can orbit.
<p>

This last issue is a strong reason for disallowing collisions between
friendly players: you could never have more than about four people in orbit
at once, and getting more than two in orbit would require a minor feat of
coordination.

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
Gravity is really sort of silly.  It won't do anything but make it harder
to get away from a planet.  Might be useful for dodging sideways or running,
but you either need to make it too weak to be interesting or too strong
to be playable.
<p>

Moving planets is harder than it seems.  The client wasn't designed to allow
planets to move.  You will also increase the amount of network traffic (by
quite a bit, since planet positions are currently only sent right after you
log on) and the CPU load, which are Bad Things.  It really isn't all that
exciting anyway.  It can change the galaxy around making Kli or Ori space
more "fair", but any serious amount of movement will have to be carefully
tested so you don't end up with cluster-galaxies and huge neutral zones.
It's been done once or twice and hasn't been really popular.

23. Set up an invitation-only clue server.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
There are so many clueless weenies flying around that I'm not having fun
anymore.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Set up a clue-only server.  Access would be by invitation only, with players
selected by the admin or invited automatically after achieving a certain rank
on certain servers.
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
It's been tried.  auk.warp.cs.cmu.edu was run this way, and nobody ever
played there.
<p>

There are two fundamental problems with the proposal.  First, the invitation
mechanism is bad.  Either the server admin has to spend a fair amount of time
adding players and passwords, or it has to be done automatically.  However, as
discussed earlier, rank is a horrible indication of clue, talent, and skill.
Automated systems will be prone to adding clueless players with lots of hours
or missing clueful players who just don't care about rank (or reset their
stats).
<p>

Even if that were solved, there's another problem: it's not easy to get 16
clueful players in one place at one time.  Players come in and out constantly.
Getting it organized is a pain and is just too inconvenient for the players
to make it worth doing.
<p>

auk failed miserably because nobody worked to get the players there (apparently
it was also a bit on the slow side).  If you propose this, be prepared to
accept the burden of organizing it.  Many people have said, "somebody should
do this", but nothing will happen until "somebody" steps up and does it.
<p>

If you want to set one up, feel free, but don't expect much UNLESS you are
willing to spend a LOT of time massaging the player database, sending e-mail
to players, and doing general organizational stuff.
<p>

One acceptable alternative is the "minimal clue" system that Nick Trown came
up with.  Basically, after you sign in the server tells you to send a message
to yourself.  If you don't, you get blown up, and eventually get kicked out.
All this does is require the player to have the message window *mapped*,
which is a big step toward playing in a clued manner.  It has been tried and
generally accepted as a Good Thing, though many feel it doesn't go far enough.
It's now in the vanilla server, and most Bronco servers have some form of
clue-checking.

24. Allow ships to drop mines.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
There just aren't enough ways to kill things.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Allow ships to drop mines which explode when you run into them.
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
The first thing to ask yourself is, what good are they?  A new way to
runner scum?  Maybe it's supposed to garrison an SB or planet?  Or is it
just a new toy added for the hell of it?
<p>

They aren't really all that useful unless you want to give them serious
damage capability (say 150 points - otherwise I'll come by in an AS and soak
up half a dozen), in which case they'll be used either while running away at
maxwarp or during oggs, essentially giving you a single big torp.  If you
make them more expensive than torps, they won't get used here, but when will
they be used?
<p>

Guarding an SB?  Just steer around them, or send a suicide minesweeper in.
For a planet?  Maybe.  It might slow down SC-taking.  If they can be destroyed
with phaser shots though then they're pretty much worthless.  On the other
hand, during an LPS you could have everyone on your team drop a mine on the
home planet, making it impossible to take.
<p>

One proposal was to allow SBs to either fire torps or mines (i.e. you would
choose on an individual basis whether what you fire is going to be a torp or
a mine).  This restricts the #of mines active by essentially crippling the
starbase every time it drops one.  It also requires that the team HAVE an SB
for them to work at all.  Something like this was tried on Calvin.
<p>

At any rate, all mine proposals have one major flaw: how to display them.
Unless you want to force a change to the client code, you have to represent
them with a player's torps, plasmas, etc.  Unfortunately these tend to look
just like vestigal torps which were "forgotten" by a UDP connection, so
remote players tend to slam into them (or end up swerving around bogus torps).
If you want to get fancy (say, have two standard torps orbiting each other)
you will be using two torps per mine (which might not be a bad thing).
<p>

If you're going to propose this, you need to consider:
<li>who gets them (ship type, #of kills, rank)
<p>
<li>how many each person/team gets
<p>
<li>how they are drawn (plasma, photon, phaser, Iggy?)
<p>
<li>how they are removed (only on collision, at request of "owner", when
phasered, when plasmaed, after n seconds)
<p>
<li>how much damage they do (point-blank damage + blast radius)
<p>
<li>whether or not they can be tractored/pressored/beamed
<p>
<li>whether they can be dropped while cloaked (VERY bad idea)
<p>
<li>who causes them to explode (other team, everyone, all != owner, non-cloakers,
just cloakers, other exploding mines)
<p>
<li>who takes damage (other team, everyone, all != owner)

The really hard part is making them useful but not abuseable.

25. Have the client update the torps instead of the server.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
A lot of network traffic is spent sending torp updates.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
This could be avoided by just sending the "start" packet with direction and
speed, and sending an "end" packet when the torpedo dies.
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
The main difficulty is losing synchronization with the server.  If a "torp
death" packet is lost or delayed, the position of the torpedo will be
inaccurate because of torp wobble or possible early expiration.  It might
reduce net traffic, but it could be really confusing.
<p>

The biggest obstacle is "torp wobble", which is a random change in direction
added every update.  If the client misses an update, the torp will continue
off in the previous direction until the next update arrives, at which point
it will jerk back on course.  This can be worked around by sending a random
number seed to the client, and then having the client emulate the wobble,
but this is just making more work for the client and creating the opportunity
for borgs to accurately predict wobbling torps.
<p>

Since borgs have all but disappeared from the scene, and most machines 
aren't taxed for CPU, this change has become more realistic; however, the 
problem of synchronization is not a small one.  This idea is often batted
around when people discuss creating a format for recording netrek games
that doesn't take enormous amounts of space.  It's a lot of coding and
testing, though.

26. Have ships come in at the starbase instead of a planet.
</h4>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
LPSs are hard to break, and transwarp is nice but not really necessary.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Have ships come in at their starbase instead of a planet.
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
One big reason is that a traitor SB could drag its entire team off into 3rd
space, allowing an easy genocide by the other team.  This isn't a problem
in clued games, but it only takes one bozo.
<p>

It has some tactical problems, like making it impossible for the starbase
to sneak around cloaked.  Killing the starbase becomes easier or more
difficult depending on where the new ships come in: newbies appearing right
on top of the SB and exploding repeatedly will make it die faster, while
clued players appearing a short distance away will increase its lifespan
by providing a continual escort.
<p>

But, worst of all, it makes Ged happy.
<p>

You can avoid some of the problems by looking at SB docking permission
or having people set a preference somehow, but the usual question needs to
be answered: does this really enhance the game?
<p>

Incidentally, a little-known fact is that ships do NOT have to come in at
the home planet.  The server admin can specify a list of planets in the
server .sysdef file, and have one chosen at random.  This feature is rarely

Either have players with more DI move through the queue faster, or have
the players get booted to the end after every time they die.
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
For the first one, you're increasing the importance of DI, which will lead
to more scumming.  It will also encourage people to play on only one or two
servers, share high-DI logins with friends, and will effectively block
newbies from playing.  Increasing the importance of DI is *not* a worthwhile
goal.
<p>

In the second case, you're making life incredibly valuable.  Nobody will want
to ogg if it means waiting for a couple of minutes to get back in... and
when people start guarding their lives carefully, the wait queue will take
longer and longer to shrink.  There is also the (non-trivial) problem of
balancing the wait queue across teams (if three FEDs die do you let three

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
Netrek's clumsy and outdated user interface requires you to use the mouse

<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Define keys that turn your ship regardless of the position of the mouse.
These could be incremental (turn 1/16th per keypress) or continuous (keep
turning left until you hit the other one).
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
There are two very important actions that require you to position the
mouse: dodging and shooting.  You can't dodge torps and shoot in the same
instant unless you want to dodge directly at your target.  Only borgs
and robots can do this.
<p>

A player who practices with these keys for a while will be able to
maintain a continuous phaser lock and fire torps while effectively dodging
enemy torps.  There are a few people who can approximate this with the
current setup, but they are among the best dogfighters in the game.  This
change would make it much easier for people to reach the pinnacle of
dogfighting skill, which is not a desirable quality in a game.  If there's
no challenge, there's no point in playing.
<p>

The argument about Netrek's interface being clumsy is ridiculous.  F-16
fighter pilots (who fly a very capable combat borg) have stated that they

30. Prevent butt-torping.
</h4></a>

<strong>Problem:</strong><br>
Twinks in DDs keep toasting my CA by firing torps while running away.
<p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong><br>
Prevent players from butt-torping by altering the way torps fired out
of the rear 60 degrees or so are handled.
<p>

<strong>Why Not:</strong><br>
"Hey Doc, it hurts when I do this."  If you're getting butt-torped to death, 
you have to stop flying into the torps.  If that means not killing the other 
guy, then don't kill him.
<p>

Players who do nothing but butt-torp are lousy space controllers and
are remarkably easy to clear off planets (just cloak and charge in their
general direction).
<p>

Netrek physics are such that torpedos always move at the same speed,
regardless of the speed of the ship that fired them.  This means that
firing while running works to your advantage, since their torps have
a closing velocity of (12 - yourspeed), whereas yours have a closing
velocity of (12 + theirspeed) (assuming CA torps).
<p>

Various proposals have been suggested (and often implemented) over time,
including:
<p>

<li>"vector torps", where the firing ship's velocity is taken into
account.  In the above example, the closing speed for both sets
of torps would be warp 12 if yourspeed == theirspeed.  Care must
be taken to avoid giving SCs warp 28 torps.  Also, butt-torping
a starbase that has you tractored becomes next to impossible.
<p>
<li>no torps out the rear section
<p>
<li>limited # of torps out the rear
<p>
<li>higher wtemp/fuel cost for torps out the rear
<p>

If you want to implement one of the latter proposals, you must also take
into account things like starbases (which don't really have a front and
back), and orbiting ships (they aren't running, just happen to be on one
side of the planet and not the other).  These ideas weren't all that
popular in practice, because most players spin around a lot while fighting,
and even though they aren't running they are still penalized.

Some people differentiate between "runner-scumming" and "butt-torping",

databases, getting rid of duplicate names, deciding which person gets
to keep "James T. Kirk", etc.  You also create update problems; if the
database is stored on a central server that the netrek servers query when
you log in, you create a failure point for the whole network of servers.
If the database server goes down, you can't use your character anywhere.
And if you have each server maintain its own database, what happens when
you play three hours on wormhole, quit out and then play three hours
on lexus?  Getting that information into the central database is a mess.
<p>
More than that, you run into problems with ratings.  Your ratings are a 
measure of how often you do something compared with the average person
in the database, so if your planet rating is 2.0, you take a planet twice
as often as the average person.  The problem is, not all servers are 
created equal.  The big-name servers like wormhole and lexus tend to have
a higher level of clue than new or lesser-known servers; because of this,
it's harder to take planets, bomb, or kill people on wormhole than on
(say) curly.  You can't fairly compare planet ratings from the two servers.
<p>
Besides, it's silly.  Get some originality and come up with a unique name.
Everything from Star Trek and Star Wars has been taken, as well as
most things from Asimov books (ugh), and just about anything containing the
word "anus".

A1. Appendix: Sturgeon II changes
</h4></a>
This comes from the motd (Message Of The Day) on sturgeon.cs.washington.edu,
port 2592.  Other upgrade servers (and even sturgeon itself) may differ at
the time you read this; this is more for example than anything else.
<p>

[ This was added some time in late 1992, and is now very much out of date. ]

<pre>
This server has a lot of changes.  I shall try to describe all the ones
I can remember making.  There may be a couple more.

(1) Phasers have longer range, but damage does not decrease linearly, but
    rather with the square of the range.  They're faster on bigger ships.

(2) Only starbases and battleships can fire a stream of 8 photon torps.
    Cruisers are limited to six, destroyers five, assault ships four,
    and scouts three.  Starbases have fighters too (hit "C" to toggle)

(3) Photon torpedos are identical for all ships, in terms of fuel cost,
    damage, fuse, and weapon temperature.

(4) Phasers do double damage to shields, and photons double damage
    to "hull" (damage points).  Example: 15 point phaser hit to shields
    of 20 will reduce the shields to 0 with the first 10 pts, and do 5
    hull points with the remainder.  Not many ships can take more than
    one torp hit to downed shields.

(5) All ships can fire torps while cloaked, at 5x normal cost (300 x 5)

(6) Cloaking enemies will be revealed for a short time if (a) they get
    hit by a torpedo, (b) they get hit by phasers with their shields up,
    or (c) you detonate your own torpedos, to show them in a radius.

(7) Upgrades.  If you refit to the same ship type, you can "upgrade"
    some aspects of your ship, in return for kills.  If you refit
    to another ship type, you regain most of your "used up" kills.
    
(8) Plasma torps now "cost" 2.0 kills.  They only take two seconds
    to upgrade.  They are "upgrade 2", and are *not* automatic for
    refits from ships with 2+ kills.

(9) Scouts don't bomb; they strafe.  While this is much less time
    efficient, the advantage is that they can strafe until a planet
    has less than TWO armies.

(A) Planets now have variable resources.  Home planets (Ear, Rom, Kli, Ori)
    are always Fuel/Repair/Agri, and Core planets are always Agri.  Any
    planet with less than 10 armies is Agri; from 10-19 it is Fuel, from
    20-39 Repair, and Fuel/Repair from 40 on up.

(B) Phasers can be fired before they fully recharge.  This costs the same
    amount of fuel, but does less damage.

(C) The base number of kills received is equal to (Hull points of victim) /
    (Your hull points).  Thus, a scout destroyed by a cruiser is only worth
    0.75 kills, while the cruiser is worth 1.33 to the scout.


UPGRADES
--------

To upgrade, have available kills and orbit your home planet.  Refit to
the same ship type, and a menu will come up on your messages display.
Press the number corresponding to the upgrade you want.  The kills will
be deducted from the number available, and your ship will be upgraded
(with some amount of refit time, depending on the upgrade).

In all menus, press 0 (or a non-number) to abort.

 From the Main Menu, 1 works the same as the classic refit (fixes damage,
shields, fuel, wtemp, etemp).

Upgrades cost k1 + k2 * (previous upgrades of same type) kills, listed
as (k1/+k2), and your ship will be nonresponsive for that many seconds.

Upgrades include:

 - Shields            +10 pts to your shield maximum                 (1.0/ 0.0)
 - Fuel capacity      +250 fuel maximum                              (0.5/ 0.0)
 - Fuel recharge      +10 fuel/sec                                   (0.5/+0.5)
 - Max Speed          +1 to maximum warp speed                       (2.0/+1.0)
 - Acceleration       +0.1 warp/sec acceleration                     (0.5/+0.1)
 - Deceleration       +0.1 warp/sec deceleration                     (0.5/ 0.0)
 - Engine Cooling     +10 engine temp cooling/sec                    (1.0/+0.5)
 - Phasers            +3 to point-blank damage                       (1.0/+1.0)
 - Photons            +1 to photon torpedo *speed* (base is 15)      (3.0/+2.0)
 - Weapon Cooling     +10 weapon temp cooling/sec                    (2.0/+2.0)
 - Cloaking Device    halve the fuel cost (round up)                 (2.0/+1.0)
 - Tractor/Pressor    +100 tractor/pressor strength                  (1.0/+0.5)
 - Damage Control     +1 damage repair/sec                           (1.0/+1.0)

Commodities: upgrades that are "no deposit, no return"...

 - Overload shields   +50 pts to your current shields, one use only  (1.0/ 0.0)

 - Pseudoplasma        0  pt plasma (12)                             (1.0/ 0.0)
 - Type 1 Plasma       50 pt plasma (12)           All plasmas cost: (2.0/ 0.0)
 - Type 2 Plasma       75 pt plasma ( 6) 
 - Type 3 Plasma      100 pt plasma ( 4)
 - Type 4 Plasma      125 pt plasma ( 3)
 - Type 5 Plasma      150 pt plasma ( 2)

 - 10 megaton nuke    Just like in Nuclear War (1 army = 1 million)  (1.0/ 0.0)
 - 20 megaton nuke    The tables have been duplicated, except for    (2.0/ 0.0)
 - 50 megaton nuke      the "destroy the solar system", which may    (4.0/ 0.0)
 - 100 megaton nuke     later...                                     (8.0/ 0.0)

Plasmas cost no fuel to fire.  Nukes take up (1/2/3/4) army bays until used.

A2. Appendix: Extreme Netrek
</h4></a>

<pre>
From: async@illuminati.io.com (Felix Sebastian Gallo)

Three planets; earth, rom, indi.  In an equilateral triangle 1.5 screen
lengths on a side.  All planets start with 30 armies; Indi has independent
armies.  No pops, no agris, all planets repair/fuel.  Bases regenerate
with 45 seconds remaining.  Six-player t-mode, anyone can base.  Standard
vanilla ships.  First side to take a planet wins; after five minutes of
t-mode the galaxy resets. 
</pre>
A game similar to this one has been implemented in the vanilla server.
If you go to an empty server with some friends and send TRIPLE to yourself,
you may be able to play Triple Planet Mayhem.  It's a nice change of pace.

<hr>
<a name="A3"><h4>
A3. Appendix: How to propose a change
</h4></a>

First of all, if it's in here, don't post it to rec.games.netrek.  It's in
here for a reason: it was suggested, and died.  That doesn't mean you can't
ask a server deity to add it for you; some of them are quite amenable to new
ideas (the weirder the better).
<p>

The most important item to remember is DETAIL.  Describe your change in
absolutely painful amounts of detail.  Include sample code at the end, if
you have it.
<p>

For example, take a look at <a href="#24">Clever Suggestion #24</a> 
(mine dropping).  I have
a list of questions that must be answered by the person proposing what, on
the surface, seems to be a very simple idea.  You need to anticipate what
people will ask, and provide details for all contingencies.
<p>

A modest proposal might look like this:
<p>
<li>Summary: explain in a couple of sentences what you want to do.
<p>
<li>Explanation: explain in depth how what you're planning will work, from
a player's perspective.  Don't include lists of source files, cost
estimates, or source code here; this should be readable by Admiral
Fubar, even if old Foo couldn't write a line of C to save his/her/its
life.
<p>
<li>Justification: explain why the world needs this change.  Explain how
it will improve the game, and why it is important enough to spend time
doing it.
<p>
<li>Rebuttal: play Devil's Advocate, and dream up every possible objection
to your proposal.  Then answer those objections.  This ought to save
hundreds if not thousands of dollars by avoiding yet another r.g.n
flamefest.  It will also make it easier to add to the FOCS.
<p>
<li>Technical stuff: if you've already made the changes or you're familiar
with the client and server, explain where you think the changes need
to be made and how much effort it will take.  Include source code here
if you have it, but keep it short!  If it's huge, make the context diffs
or the modified files available for FTP.
<p>

If you just have a dopey little change, there's no reason in the world why
you can't just post the code to r.g.n and say, "here's some nice code, feel
free to use it if you want."  I did visible tractor beams this way, and look
at how far they've gone.  (Tedd Hadley gets credit for the nice segemented
lines though.)  All source code bug fixes are posted this way, usually as
context diffs (use diff -c oldfile newfile ... the order is important).
