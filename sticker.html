They are in!!
I had to go with a simpler design, the cost to print out Tim Broudy's design
was through the roof because of the amount of detail.  Email me your mailing
address and I will send a couple out to you.  Anyone know what is costs to
send a standard envelope to Europe or Canada?  Niclas would you mind if I
sent a bunch to you to take care of the Euro side of things if the mailing
cost is too high?  Check out the link below to see what it looks like.  They
are free.

Joe has sent a bunch (20? 40?) of stickers to me. If you live in Europe
and want a sticker then mail me your address and I'll send you one.
